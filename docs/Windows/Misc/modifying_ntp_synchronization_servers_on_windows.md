## Introduction

I have a Windows Server 2008 DC and I wanted to use my internal time server on a Linux box running ntpd.

After a little hunting around, I found the command required to set Windows up to use the correct time peer.

## Configuration

```bash
w32tm /config /update /manualpeerlist:"0.pool.ntp.org,0x8 1.pool.ntp.org,0x8" /syncfromflags:MANUAL
```

After making this change, you need to restart the Windows Time Service by issuing the following 2 commands:

```bash
net stop w32time
net start w32time
```

If you have problems, first make sure the Windows Time Service is enabled.

Note: This works with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.
