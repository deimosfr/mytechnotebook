## Introduction

Compared to Linux, Solaris is quite similar except for certain aspects which I will clarify here. This guide will not only cover Solaris but also include general information about disk architecture and filesystems.

## Physical Operation

### Files, Inodes and Blocks

On your hard drive, where you store your data, there is a hierarchical structure:

* Directories and files
* Inodes
* Blocks

Inodes are what know exactly where each directory/file is located. When you create or call a file, it points to an inode. This inode is then able to identify which data block it belongs to (binary slice). Here's a small explanation with an image:

![Hdd function](../../static/images/hdd_fonction.avif)

### Hardware Recognition

To recognize where a specific device is located on our system, here's a brief explanation:
Assuming we have a file in /dev like: c0t0d0s0. This means:

* c0: On **C**ontroller **0**
* t0: On SCSI **T**arget **0**
* d0: I have **D**isk **0**
* s0: And I am positioned on **S**lice **0**

Here are some examples:

#### SCSI

![Sun hdd scsi](../../static/images/sun_hdd_scsi.avif)

#### IDE

![Sun hdd ide](../../static/images/sun_hdd_ide.avif)

### Slices

Then, the slices (also called partitions) are defined as follows for better performance optimization:

![Sun slice](../../static/images/sun_slice.avif)

## What About My Machine?

To start, you should know what's on your machine. For this, there are 3 solutions:

### path_to_inst

```bash
cat /etc/path_to_inst
```

```
#
#       Caution! This file contains critical kernel state

```

### Prtconf

```bash
prtconf | grep -v not
```

```

          /pci@0,0/pci-ide@7,1/ide@0/cmdk@0,0
```

## Adding a Device

### With Reboot

To have our disk detected at boot, we need to create a `/reconfigure` file:

```bash
touch /reconfigure
```

Then, simply connect your device and restart your machine. Once done, configure the slices.

### Without Reboot

If it's a "critical" machine, you need to run the "devfsadm" command. This command will try to match the loaded kernel drivers with the devices in `/devices`.

Here are some usage examples:

* Defining devices such as disk, tape, port, audio or pseudo:

```bash
devfsadm -c disk -c tape -c audio
```

* Configure only one device based on the driver:

```bash
devfsadm -i driver_name
```

* Configure disks only supported by certain controllers (dad, st or sd)

```bash
devfsadm -i dad
```

* For verbose mode

```bash
devfsadm -v
```

* To flush (clear) symbolic links that point to non-existent devices:

```bash
devfsadm -c
```

## Partitioning

The disk partitioning is made of slices that are delimited by cylinders. Indeed, a slice occupies a strip of cylinders (ex: 1 to 2850). Then the next slice will go from 2850 to 5000.

The partitions are therefore determined from the first cylinder of each slice:

* Slice 1: Cylinder 0 to 2850
* Slice 2: Cylinder 2850 to 5000

...

### Waste

Wasting cylinders creates a potentially empty slice. You can use it later. However, in case of defective sectors, it is possible that the partition will shrink due to lost cylinders.

### Overlapping

Overlapping occurs when multiple slices access the same cylinder (usually one slice encroaching on another). To fix this problem, when you edit your partition, use the "modify" command:

```bash
modify
```

```
        Select partitioning base:
                0. Current partition table (unnamed)
                1. All Free Hog
        Choose base (enter number) [0]? 0
        Warning: Overlapping partition (1) in table.
        Warning: Fix, or select a different partition table.
```

### Defining Partitions

The format command automatically handles partitioning according to data in `/etc/format.dat`. The advantage is that it's super fast and easy when adding a disk. Now, manually, here's how to do it:

```bash
format
```

```
Searching for disks...done

AVAILABLE DISK SELECTIONS:
       0. c0t0d0 <ST38410A cyl 16706 alt 2 hd 16 sec 63>
          /pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/dad@0,0
       1. c1t3d0 <SUN9.0G cyl 4924 alt 2 hd 27 sec 133>
          /pci@1f,0/pci@1/scsi@1/sd@3,0
Specify disk (enter its number):
```

Now we have the list of detected disks. We'll choose the second disk and continue:

```
Specify disk (enter its number): 1

  7 unassigned    wm     0            0         (0/0/0)           0
```

Here is the meaning of the columns:


| Column Name | Description |
|---------|----------|
| Part | Slice number of the disk |
| Tag | Predefined tag (optional) |
| Flag | Predefined flag (optional) |
| Cylinders | Start and end cylinder of the slice |
| Size | Size of the slice in blocks (b), cylinders (c), Mbytes (MB), or Gbytes (GB) |
| Blocks | Total number of cylinders and sectors per slice |


To start configuring the disk, type **0**:

```bash
partition> 0
```

```
Part      Tag    Flag  Cylinders    Size        Blocks
  0 unassigned    wm    0           0     (0/0/0)           0
```

Type **?** to get the list of possible choices:

```bash
Enter partition id tag[unassigned]: ?
```

```
Expecting one of the following: (abbreviations ok):
        unassigned    boot          root          swap
        usr           backup        stand         var
        home          alternates    reserved
Enter partition id tag[unassigned]:
```

Type **alternates**:

```bash
Enter partition id tag[unassigned]: alternates
```

Type **?** to get the list of possible choices:

```bash
Enter partition permission flags[wm]: ?
```

```
Expecting one of the following: (abbreviations ok):
        wm    - read-write, mountable
        wu    - read-write, unmountable
        rm    - read-only, mountable
        ru    - read-only, unmountable

Enter partition permission flags[wm]:
```

Press the "Enter" key:

```bash
Enter partition permission flags[wm]:
```

Press "Enter" again to accept cylinder 0 as starting point:

```bash
Enter new starting cyl[0]:
```

Enter the size of the partition (here 980mb):

```bash
Enter partition size[0b, 0c, 0e, 0.00mb, 0.00gb]: 980mb
```

Let's check:

```bash
partition> print
```

```
Current partition table (unnamed):
Total disk cylinders available: 1965 + 2 (reserved cylinders)

Part      Tag    Flag   Cylinders     Size            Blocks

  7 unassigned    wm     0            0         (0/0/0)          0
```

We can see the changes. Let's adjust the start cylinder of slice 1:

```bash
partition> 1
```

```
Part      Tag    Flag   Cylinders    Size        Blocks
  1 unassigned    wm     0           0     (0/0/0)          0
```

Enter "**swap**":

```bash
Enter partition id tag[unassigned]: swap
```

Type "**wu**":

```bash
Enter partition permission flags[wm]: wu
```

Enter the start cylinder of slice 1:

```bash
Enter new starting cyl[0]: 559
```

Enter the new size of the partition:

```bash
Enter partition size[0b, 0c, 603e, 0.00mb, 0.00gb]: 512mb
```

Let's check:

```bash
partition> print
```

```
Current partition table (unnamed):
Total disk cylinders available: 1965 + 2 (reserved cylinders)

Part      Tag    Flag   Cylinders     Size          Blocks

  7 unassigned    wm     0            0       (0/0/0)          0
```

Let's do the same for slice 7:

```bash
partition> 7
```

```
Part      Tag    Flag     Cylinders        Size            Blocks
  7 unassigned    wm       0               0         (0/0/0) 0
```

Type "**home**":

```bash
Enter partition id tag[unassigned]: home
```

Press the "Enter" key:

```bash
Enter partition permission flags[wm]:
```

Enter the starting cylinder:

```bash
Enter new starting cyl[0]: 852
```

Enter the value "**$**" to occupy all available free space in this partition:

```bash
Enter partition size[0b, 0c, 694e, 0.00mb, 0.00gb]: $
```

Let's check:

```bash
partition> print
```

```
Current partition table (unnamed):

```

After checking that there are no errors, type **label**:

```bash
partition> label
Ready to label disk, continue? y
```

### Checking Labels

To check labels (also called VTOC), there are 2 solutions:

* Use **verify** in the **format** utility
* Use the **prtvtoc** command

#### Reading the VTOC with Format

Open the format utility, then type verify:

```bash
format> verify
```

```
Primary label contents:

Volume name = <        >

```

To quit, type **q**.

#### Reading the VTOC with Prtvtoc

Run the command on a disk:

```bash
prtvtoc /dev/dsk/c1t3d0s0
```

```
* /dev/dsk/c1t3d0s0 partition map
*
* Dimensions:
*     512 bytes/sector
*     133 sectors/track
*      27 tracks/cylinder
*    3591 sectors/cylinder
*    4926 cylinders
*    4924 accessible cylinders
*
* Flags:
*   1: unmountable
*  10: read-only
*
*                          First     Sector    Last
* Partition  Tag  Flags    Sector     Count    Sector  Mount Directory

       7      8    00    3059532  14622552  17682083
```

Here are some explanations:


| Field | Description |
|---------|----------|
| Dimensions | Describes the logical dimensions of the disk |
| Flags | Describes the flags listed in the partition table |
| Partition | The slice number described later in the partition table |

## In Case of Problems

### Relabeling Disks

The fmthard command allows you to relabel disks. First, let's save the current VTOC in a file:

```bash
prtvtoc /dev/dsk/c1t3d0s0 > /var/tmp/c1t3d0.vtoc
```

We can save the VTOC of another disk in a file to relabel it on a new disk:

```bash
fmthard -s datafile /dev/rdsk/c#t#d#s2
```

Open format, select the disk and give it the desired name. Then reinject the saved VTOC:

```bash
mthard -s /var/tmp/c1t3d0.vtoc /dev/rdsk/c1t3d0s2
```

Finally, to initialize the disk:

```bash
fmthard -s /dev/null /dev/rdsk/c1t3d0s2
```

## FileSystems

There are 4 types of FileSystems in Solaris:

* ufs: The most used FileSystem in Solaris. It can easily go up to Terabits, is based on the Berkeley system
* hsfs: A somewhat special Sierra system
* pcfs: For FAT32 and DOS
* udfs: Universal Disk File System, this is for CD/DVD media...

Here is a description of UFS:

![Sun ufs](../../static/images/sun_ufs.avif)

As well as how inodes work:

![Sun ufs inodes](../../static/images/sun_ufs_inodes.avif)

### Creating the FileSystem

The **newfs** command allows you to do this:

```bash
newfs /dev/rdsk/c1t3d0s7
```

Answer **y** to this confirmation:

```bash
newfs: construct a new file system /dev/rdsk/c1t3d0s7: (y/n)?
```

It now displays information about the filesystem creation:

```
/dev/rdsk/c1t3d0s7: 6295022 sectors in 1753 cylinders of 27 tracks, 
133 sectors 3073.7MB in 110 cyl groups (16 c/g, 28.05MB/g, 3392 i/g)
super-block backups (for fsck -F ufs -o b=#) at:
 32, 57632, 115232, 172832, 230432, 288032, 345632, 403232, 460832,
 518432, 5746208, 5803808, 5861408, 5919008, 5976608, 6034208, 6091808,
 6149408, 6207008, 6264608,
```

We display the free space

```bash
fstyp -v /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s6 |head
```

```
(output omitted for brevity)
minfree 10%     maxbpg  2048    optim   time
```

The -m option defines the percentage of disk space we want to use:

```bash
newfs -m 2 /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s6
```

```
newfs: construct a new file system /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s6: (y/n)? y
(output omitted for brevity)
```

Here's the result:

```bash
fstyp -v /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s6 |head
```

```
(output omitted for brevity
minfree 2%      maxbpg  2048    optim   time
```

Verification:

```

```

To change the available space:

```bash
tunefs -m 1 /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0
```

```
minimum percentage of free space changes from 10% to 1%
```

### Checking Disk Status

The fsck command, like in Linux, allows you to check the integrity of the filesystem to repair any orphaned inodes (**don't forget to unmount the partition before performing this operation**):

```bash
fsck /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s7
```

```
** /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s7
** Last Mounted on /export/home
** Phase 1 - Check Blocks and Sizes
INCORRECT BLOCK COUNT I=743 (5 should be 2)
CORRECT?
```

If there are files that can be recovered, you will find them in "lost+found". Check if they are correct with the "file" command. It is estimated that if "file" can determine what type of file it is, then it's correct.

## Vfstab

The `/etc/vfstab` file is the equivalent of `/etc/fstab` in Linux. It lists all partitions and their mount points.

```
#device         device          mount           FS      fsck    mount   mount
#to mount       to fsck         point           type    pass    at boot options

```

### mtab

The `/etc/mtab` file informs us about mountings in relation to the kernel:

```bash
more /etc/mnttab
```

```

## Mounting Partitions

To manually mount partitions, there is the mount command. Here are some examples:

Mount the filesystem as read-only:

```bash
mount -o ro /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s7 /export/home
```

Set sticky bits across the entire partition:

```bash
mount -o ro,nosuid /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s7 /export/home
```

Remove access dates for each file, which optimizes access times

```bash
mount -o noatime /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s7 /export/home
```

If this partition only contains small files, use this option:

```bash
mount -o nolargefiles /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s7 /export/home
```

To mount all the contents of your `/etc/vfstab` file, use this command:

```bash
mountall
```

To only mount what is local:

```bash
mountall -l
```

### Determining the Mount Type

To know which options to pass, here are some interesting files:

* `/etc/vfstab` for FS
* `/etc/default/fs` for a local filesystem
* `/etc/dfs/fstypes` for remote filesystems

To know the characteristics of a partition:

```bash
fstyp /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s7
```

```
ufs
```

You can specify during partition mounting if it's hsfs or pcfs:

```bash
mount -F hsfs -o ro /dev/dsk/c0t6d0s0 /cdrom
```

To unmount a partition, do this:

```bash
umount mount_point
```

And to force, use the -f option:

```bash
umount -f mount_point
```

## What's Happening on My Partition?

fuser is what allows in Solaris to know what's happening on the partition. In Linux, it's lsof. To list all processes running on this partition:

```bash
fuser -cu mount_point
```

To kill all processes:

```bash
fuser -ck mount_point
```

Check that no processes are on the partition:

```bash
fuser -c mount_point
```

## Problems with My Root Partition

If you want to fsck the root partition, insert the Sun CD/DVD then type this:

```bash
ok boot cdrom -s
```

```
Boot device: /pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/cdrom@2,0:f File and args -s

INIT: SINGLE USER MODE
```

Run fsck on your root partition:

```bash
fsck /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0
```

If everything worked well, you should be able to mount everything:

```bash
mount /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0 /a
```

Otherwise, you need to fine-tune `/etc/vfstab`:

```bash
TERM=sun
export TERM
vi /a/etc/vfstab
```

Then we exit and restart:

```bash
cd /
umount /a
```

## Access to Removable Devices

### With Vold

Where to find the peripherals:


| Media | Filesystem Access | Mounted Access |
|---------|----------|----------|
| diskette | /floppy/floppy0 | /vol/dev/aliases/floppy0 |
| CD-ROM | /cdrom/cdrom0 | /vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0 |
| Jaz | /rmdisk/jaz0 | /vol/dev/aliases/jaz0 |
| Zip | /rmdrive/zip0 | /vol/dev/aliases/zip0 |
| PCMCIA | /pcmem0 | /vol/dev/aliases/pcmem0 |


There are 2 files that manage actions during media insertion/ejection:

* `/etc/vold.conf`
* `/etc/rmmount.conf`

Vold is a service (start, stop...):

```bash
/etc/init.d/volmgt restart
```

If it really doesn't want to quit:

```bash
pkill -9 vold
```

### Without Vold

Obviously you have to do everything manually:

```bash
mount -F hsfs -o ro /dev/dsk/c0t6d0s0 /cdrom
mount -F pcfs /dev/diskette /pcfs
```
