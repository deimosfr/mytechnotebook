Here's a simple but very useful trick. The `isainfo` command allows you to determine the architecture of a machine:

```bash
$ isainfo -v
64-bit amd64 applications
        pause sse2 sse fxsr amd_3dnowx amd_3dnow amd_mmx mmx cmov amd_sysc cx8 
        tsc fpu 
32-bit i386 applications
        pause sse2 sse fxsr amd_3dnowx amd_3dnow amd_mmx mmx cmov amd_sysc cx8 
        tsc fpu
```

I can see here that my system is 64-bit and also has compatibility for 32-bit applications.
