## Google Search Tips

Here are some useful tips for searching with Google:

- `"keyword"`: Will search for the exact term "keyword" as it is enclosed in quotation marks
- `0 * 0 = toto's head`: Will search for all possible options in place of the * symbol
- `DHCP -microsoft`: Will search for DHCP everywhere the word "microsoft" is not present
- `WSUS -site:microsoft.com`: Will search for WSUS everywhere except on the Microsoft website
- `user OR $USER OR %username%`: Will search for multiple possibilities
- `define:"SUN Solaris"`: Will directly search for the definition rather than pages talking about SUN Solaris
- `manual cpu intel filetype:pdf`: The filetype option allows you to search for specific file types such as xls, pdf, doc...
- `intitle:keyword`: Requires "keyword" to be in the title
- `inurl:keyword`: Requires "keyword" to be in the URL

## URL Parameter Tips

Here are some tricks to add at the end of the search URL:

- `&as_qdr=mX`: Replace X with the number of months. This will only show results more recent than X months.
- `&filter=0`: Shows duplicates or similar pages if they exist
