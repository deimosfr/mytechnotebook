At home, I've 2 [Sonoff remote](https://www.sonoff.be/a-57623819/telecommandes/sonoff-rm433-telecommande) controls for my Sonoff devices. It happens that I have to reset because they link together (kids plays with them). When it happens, the procedure was painful to remember, so I wrote it down here.

To reset a Sonoff remote control and appair it, follow these steps:

- Shut down the power to the Sonoff device.
- Push and hold the bottom-left button on the remote control.
- While holding the button, turn on the power to the Sonoff device.
- Continue holding the button for 5 to 10 seconds.

The remote control should now be reset and paired with the Sonoff device.
