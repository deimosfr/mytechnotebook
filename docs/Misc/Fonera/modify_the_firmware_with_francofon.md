## Introduction

I'd like to modify the original firmware to have more functionality. That's why I opted for this firmware. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this article, it's not possible to run this firmware on a Fonera+. Here's what it adds compared to the base firmware:

- Improved firewall management
- Simplified port redirection
- DHCP address management for the private network
- Blacklisting of certain sites for the public network
- Adding/removing DNS
- Antenna power adjustment
- Remote reboot
- Management of dyndns accounts
- Hosts file management
- Live view of connections to private and public networks
- Comparison of the Fonera version with the latest available version
- Hidden SSID management for the private network
- Language management (English, French, Romanian for now)
- Ability to update firmware from a server other than the FrancoFON server
- Ability to configure the Fonera in pppoe with the @ and / characters required by some ISPs, up to 64 characters
- Opening/closing SSH
- Opening/closing console access via ethernet
- Script to know the number of Foneras using the FrancoFON firmware
- Ability to block clients on public and private signals by MAC address with scheduler
- Ability to connect the Fonera to a WiFi AP to use its internet connection (autonomous "Fonera mode", also called "Ponte2")

## Prerequisites

You must have SSH installed on your Fonera. Use this documentation:
[Enable SSH on your Fonera+](fonera-ssh.md)

## Installation of the new firmware

Connect to your Fonera via WiFi, then via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.10.1
```

The default root password is "admin" or the Fonera management password you defined on the website.

Then, let's start the installation:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget http://download.francofon.fr/update.sh
chmod +x update.sh
sh ./update.sh
```

The Fonera will then update:

```bash
