## Introduction

By default Mac OS X doesn't show any hidden files or folders. If you want to see everything, follow these steps.

## Usage

Show all hidden objects:

```bash
$ defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
```

Swap TRUE with FALSE to turn it off again. Note: Finder must be relaunched afterwards to see the effect. For example like this:

```bash
$ killall Finder && open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app
```
