## Introduction

Newznab is a Usenet indexer. It can be used with applications like [SABnzbd](./sabnzbd_a_web_interface_for_managing_newsgroups.md) or [Sick-Beard](./sickbeard_a_pvr_relying_on_sabnzbd.md).

## Installation

Here are the required packages:

```bash
aptitude install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-curl php5-mysql php5-gd php-pear
```

Since we'll need a MySQL-type database, we'll take the opportunity to set up [MariaDB (follow this link)](../../Servers/Databases/MySQL-MariaDB/mariadb_migration_from_mysql.md).

Next, let's set up Newznab:

```bash
cd /var/www
wget http://www.newznab.com/newznab-0.2.3.zip
unzip newznab-0.2.3.zip
mv newznab-0.2.3 newznab
chown -Rf www-data. newznab
rm -f newznab-0.2.3.zip
```

Finally, let's enable Apache's rewrite mode:

```bash
a2enmod rewrite
```

## Configuration

### PHP

We'll need to configure some PHP parameters for Newznab to work properly:

```bash
perl -pi -e 's/;date.timezone =.*/date.timezone = Europe\/Paris/' /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
perl -pi -e 's/;date.timezone =.*/date.timezone = Europe\/Paris/' /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
perl -pi -e "s/max_execution_time = \d*/max_execution_time = 120/" /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
perl -pi -e "s/max_execution_time = \d*/max_execution_time = 120/" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
perl -pi -e "s/memory_limit = .*/memory_limit = 256M/" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
```

### Apache

Here's a typical configuration. Feel free to adapt it to your needs:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
        <Directory /var/www/newznab/www>
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>
        ServerAdmin admin@example.com
        ServerName example.com
        ServerAlias www.example.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/newznab/www
        LogLevel warn
        ServerSignature Off
</VirtualHost>
```

Then enable it and reload your Apache configuration:

```bash
a2ensite newznab
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload
```

### MySQL

Let's configure MySQL/MariaDB by creating a database and a user:

```bash
create database newznab;
create user 'newznab'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
grant usage ON * . * TO 'newznab'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
grant ALL on `newznab` .* to 'newznab'@'localhost';
```

Replace password with your desired password.

### Newznab

After all these modifications, restart your Apache server:

```bash
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

Then connect to your server at http://server/newznab/www and follow the instructions. Once you have added a group, you'll need to run a script to retrieve the latest headers. The result should be similar to this:

```bash
> cd /var/www/newznab/misc/update_scripts
> php update_binaries.php
PHP Warning:  mysql_pconnect(): Headers and client library minor version mismatch. Headers:50149 Library:50311 in /var/www/newznab/www/lib/framework/db.php on line 12

Next, we'll need to create the releases:

```bash

Once these actions have been executed manually, we'll set them up automatically in crontab:

```bash
0 * * * * /var/www/newznab/misc/update_scripts/cron_scripts/newznab.sh start > /dev/null
```

We'll also need to set permissions and modify default paths:

```bash
chmod 755 /var/www/newznab/misc/update_scripts/cron_scripts/newznab.sh
perl -pi -e 's/\/usr\/local\/www/\/var\/www/' /var/www/newznab/misc/update_scripts/cron_scripts/newznab.sh
```

## Usage

### Import a server list

The default server list is decent, but may not meet your expectations. I've created a small example script that retrieves a list of servers from a website, creates a "clean" list, checks if they're already in the database, then adds them all at once and activates them at the same time. Here's my script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Vars
ngs_list='liste_newsgroups'
mysql_batch='mysql_batch.sql'
database='newznab'
login='newznab'
password='password'
activate=1
url='http://www.binnews.in/_bin/newsgroup.php?country=fr'

# Getting URL
echo 'Getting newsgroups servers from URL'
wget -O $ngs_list.old "$url"
echo "Extracting all newsgroups servers"
grep title $ngs_list.old | awk -F\" '{ print $2 }' > $ngs_list

# Generate sql batch
echo "Generating SLQ batch file in $mysql_batch"
echo "" > $mysql_batch
for i in `cat $ngs_list` ; do
	if [ `mysql -u$login -p$password -e "select name from newznab.groups where name = '$i'" | grep -c $i` -eq 0 ] ; then
		echo "insert into $database.groups (name,backfill_target,first_record,first_record_postdate,last_record,last_record_postdate,last_updated,minfilestoformrelease,minsizetoformrelease,active,description) values ('$i',1,0,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,$activate,'$i');" >> $mysql_batch
	fi
done

# Import SQL
echo "Importing batch file in $database database"
mysql -u$login -p$password newznab < $mysql_batch
```

Just fill in the vars section with the correct elements, set the permissions, and run this script for a massive insertion.
