Debian provides the iconv command that allows you to transcode text to and from any character set. Example:

```bash
$ iconv -f utf8 -t iso8859-15 fichier_utf8.txt
```

This command will transcode from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-15. It's very useful if you've developed a web page in UTF-8 and realized it too late.
