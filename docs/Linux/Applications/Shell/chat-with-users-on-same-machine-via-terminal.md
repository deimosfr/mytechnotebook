## Introduction

I've been looking several times for a way to chat with other people connected to the same machine as me. And since I'm tired of searching every time how to do it, I'm noting the solutions I found here.

## Solutions

### Chat with a single user

Use the write command:

```bash
write user_you_want_to_talk_to
```

Then type your message and press Enter to validate.

### Chat with all connected users

Use the wall command:

```bash
echo "My message" | wall
```
