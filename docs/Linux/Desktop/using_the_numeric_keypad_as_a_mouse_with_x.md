## Introduction

In the series "things you should know", we have the control of the mouse pointer using the keyboard in X. If your mouse dies, it can be a real hassle - what to do? Simple, activate keyboard control.

## Usage

To activate:

```bash
[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+[NUMLOCK]
```

The pointer can then be moved using the numeric keypad keys.

* Click with [0] and [+]
* Return to normal operation with [CTRL]+[SHIFT]+[NUMLOCK]. Small beeps indicate the operation worked correctly.
* You can also use [5] to accelerate the movement.
