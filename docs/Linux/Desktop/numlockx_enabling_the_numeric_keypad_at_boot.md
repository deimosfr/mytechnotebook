## Introduction

The numeric keypad is not necessarily activated at boot time, which can quickly become annoying. Here's a method to enable it automatically on Gnome.

## Installation

```bash
apt-get install numlockx
```

## Configuration

We'll use numlockx with GDM. Insert this line into `/etc/gdm/Init/Default`:

```bash
test -x /usr/bin/numlockx && /usr/bin/numlockx on
```

Now you just need to restart your GDM and it works! :-)
