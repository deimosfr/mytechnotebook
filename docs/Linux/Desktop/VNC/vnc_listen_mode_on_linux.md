## Introduction

Yes, in Windows, listen mode is easy! But on Linux, where is the "Run listening mode" icon? ;-)

It's actually quite simple:

```bash
xvnc4viewer -listen -Shared
```

The "Shared" option allows **multiple users to connect simultaneously**.

On the client side, you need to open incoming port **5500** and you're good to go.
