## Introduction

You may need to know exactly the time it takes to execute some commands. The `time` command is perfect for this purpose.

This command is a bash builtin.

## Examples

The last semicolon `;` is important. For example:

```bash
time { rm -rf /folder/bar && mkdir -p /folder/bar ; echo "done" ; }
```

This will give you the time taken to execute the entire block of commands as a single unit.
