```bash
W: GPG error: http://security.debian.org testing/updates Release:
The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY key-number
```

Is this type of message appearing? It's quite annoying, especially since it happens every year. To solve this problem, follow these steps:

```bash
gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key key-number
gpg -a --export key-number | apt-key add -
```
