## Introduction

Troublesome drivers! Thanks to manufacturers who provide drivers with problematic licenses. In short, with Debian version 5, network cards with Broadcom chipsets stopped working properly.

No problem, here's the solution.

## Installation

Simply install this package:

```bash
apt-get install firmware-bnx2
```

A quick reboot and you're all set!
