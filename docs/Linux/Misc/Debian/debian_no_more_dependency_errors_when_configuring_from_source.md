Imagine you want to install the latest version of xyz from source on your Debian system. You run ./configure and... BLAM!!! You get a ton of errors because of libraries that aren't installed.

Well, this won't happen anymore, thanks to a very user-friendly utility called auto-apt.

To install it:

```bash
apt-get install auto-apt
```

Then, enjoy the pleasure of ./configure without errors. To use it, just type:

```bash
auto-apt run ./configure
```

instead. That's all. If apt detects an error due to a missing file, it will kindly offer to install it for you.

Just remember to update its databases regularly with:

```bash
auto-apt update
auto-apt updatedb
auto-apt update-local
```

Note: auto-apt works with any command that might need missing files: auto-apt run command.
