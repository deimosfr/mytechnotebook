## Introduction

A colleague of mine made a serious mistake (running `chown -Rf mysql` on `/`!). This caused a huge mess, and we had to find a solution to restore the correct permissions.

Fortunately, Red Hat anticipated these kinds of errors and included the `--setperms` and `--setugids` options in the `rpm` command to repair permissions on installed packages. Basically, this gives you a way to repair your machine.

So if you also made a mistake like this, know that there is a solution on Red Hat.

## Usage

Here are the two magic commands:

```bash
for u in $(rpm -qa); do rpm --setugids $u; done
for p in $(rpm -qa); do rpm --setperms $p; done
```

You'll need to do a bit of verification afterward because this only repairs the permissions of files and directories contained in installed packages. Your personal files will not have their permissions restored with this method.
