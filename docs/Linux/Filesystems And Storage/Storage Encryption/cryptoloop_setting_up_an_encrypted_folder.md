Cryptoloop is the predecessor of CryptoFS. It's a useful system because you create an empty encrypted file (image) of a specific size that can contain multiple files or folders.

You can then insert everything inside and everything is encrypted. You can even create a file the size of your partition to make a pseudo-encrypted volume. The disadvantage is that in case of a system crash, if you left the encrypted file open, you have a 50% chance of corrupting your data placed inside.

Therefore, it should be used with caution. Here is some documentation:
