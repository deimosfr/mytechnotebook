## Introduction

By default, the serial port is not activated. If you have a Soekris device, for example, it's essential to activate it. Let's see how to do this.

## Configuration

To activate the standard output on the serial port (only stdout):

```bash
echo "-h" > /boot.config
```

Alternatively, you can choose to activate the serial port only if no keyboard is connected to the machine:

```bash
echo "-P" > /boot.config
```

Next, you'll need to configure the stdin part (keyboard) by enabling this line by changing it to "on":

``` bash hl_lines="5"
# /etc/ttys
[...]
# Serial terminals
# The 'dialup' keyword identifies dialin lines to login, fingerd etc.
ttyu0   "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   dialup  on secure
[...]
```

Reboot and then all you need to do is connect to it.
