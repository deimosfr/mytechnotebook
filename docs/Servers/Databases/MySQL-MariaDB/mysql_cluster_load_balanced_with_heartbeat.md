Here is documentation that requires good knowledge of [MySQL replications](./mysql_installation_and_configuration.md) and [clustering](./replication_master_to_master.md) techniques.

It can save you a lot of time even if you have the necessary knowledge:

[Documentation on a Load-Balanced MySQL Cluster With MySQL 5.1](../../../static/pdf/load-balanced_mysql_cluster_with_mysql_5_1.pdf)
