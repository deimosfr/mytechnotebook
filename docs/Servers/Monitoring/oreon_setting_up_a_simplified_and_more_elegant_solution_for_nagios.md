## Introduction

Oreon is a network monitoring and supervision software based on the most efficient Open Source information retrieval engine: Nagios.

Today Oreon no longer exists and is called Centreon.

The objective of this project is to provide a new interface for Nagios, capable of giving it new functionalities while keeping the logic of its existing mechanisms. All within a modern, scalable interface designed for everyone.

The Oreon project benefits from a constantly growing community and unwavering investment, which allows it to make its solution increasingly robust and constantly offer innovative new tools.

You can find on the website, www.oreon-project.org, all the necessary information for integrating Oreon into your infrastructure:

* Packages to download
* Necessary documentation
* Appropriate community tools
* Professional support service

## Installation of Nagios

To install Nagios, refer to the docs in this wiki, or read this documentation written specifically for Oreon integration.  
[documentation](../../static/pdf/nagiosoreonfr.pdf)

## Installation of Oreon

You can follow this documentation.  
[documentation](../../static/pdf/oreon13fr.pdf)

However, during the installation, I encountered some dependency issues. That's why at the end of it, before proceeding to the web installation, enter these lines:

```bash
