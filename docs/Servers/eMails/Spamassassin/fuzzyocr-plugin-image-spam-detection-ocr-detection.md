## Introduction

The most widely used anti-spam tool in the open-source world is SpamAssassin. Its operation is similar to that of the amavisd-new service. It collects results obtained from a collection of other tools and passes them to the amavisd-new service, which makes a decision about the message based on its total score.

From a system perspective, implementing SpamAssassin is very simple. Just use the Debian/testing package, which is well maintained. This situation is particularly interesting because the collection of libraries and tools dependent on SpamAssassin is very large. The command:

```bash
apt-cache show spamassassin
```

lists these dependencies.

## SpamAssassin Configuration

There are 2 levels to consider when configuring this tool:

* At the system level, the `/etc/spamassassin` directory contains configuration files common to all users.
* For the amavis user, the `.spamassassin` directory located under the user's home directory contains dedicated configuration files as well as databases created during execution: automatic whitelist, calculation tokens, etc.

Since the scenarios described in this document use a dedicated gateway server for email processing, all configuration parameters will be in the general `/etc/spamassassin` directory and all databases will be in the `/var/lib/amavis/.spamassassin` directory.

## Optical Character Recognition

The trend since fall 2006 has been an explosion of spam containing animated GIF, PNG, or JPEG images. These images most often contain advertisements or dubious stock market offers.

The FuzzyOcr Plugin is a fairly effective weapon against image-containing spam. It uses optical character recognition to search for keywords in these images. This plugin also has some optimizations for processing deliberately corrupted image files.

The basic operation of the plugin, as described on the presentation web page, covers the following steps:

* Search for images in different parts of the message
* Each image is analyzed to identify its format (GIF, PNG, JPEG)
* Depending on the detected image format, different tools are called to convert the image to PNM format
* The optical character recognition program gocr is called to extract text from the PNM file
* The obtained strings are scanned for predefined words, scores are calculated, and results are transmitted to SpamAssassin

## Installing the FuzzyOCR Plugin

Unfortunately, a Debian/testing package is not yet available. Therefore, we need to do a manual installation based on the packages of the tools used by the plugin.

First, download the plugin code and place the sources in the email gateway server's directory tree:

```bash
wget http://users.own-hero.net/~decoder/fuzzyocr/fuzzyocr-latest.tar.gz
mv fuzzyocr-latest.tar.gz /usr/local/src/
cd /usr/local/src/
tar xf fuzzyocr-latest.tar.gz
chown -R root.src FuzzyOcr*
```

Next, make sure these packages are installed:

```bash
apt-get install spamassassin netpbm imagemagick libungif4g libungif-bin gocr libjpeg-progs libstring-approx-perl
```

## Configuring the FuzzyOCR Plugin

For this part, we don't follow the recommendations in the INSTALL file. Indeed, the default plugin configuration expects to use the `/etc/mail/spamassassin` directory, which doesn't exist on a Debian system. Furthermore, it's not desirable to mix code and configuration elements in the `/etc/` directory.

For the plugin code installation, the command `# dpkg -L spamassassin | grep Plugin/` helps identify the directory where other plugins used by SpamAssassin are stored: `/usr/share/perl5/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/`. So we copy the code to this directory.

```bash
cp FuzzyOcr.pm /usr/share/perl5/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/
```

For the configuration file, simply copy the following files to the general SpamAssassin configuration directory:

```bash
cp FuzzyOcr.cf /etc/spamassassin/
cp FuzzyOcr.words.sample /etc/spamassassin/FuzzyOcr.words
cd /etc/spamassassin
```

Several configuration files need to be edited to adapt to the configuration context.
We need to indicate the new plugin in the list traversed by SpamAssassin by adding a line at the end of the v310.pre file:

```bash
echo loadplugin FuzzyOcr /usr/share/perl5/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/FuzzyOcr.pm >> v310.pre
```

We need to edit the FuzzyOcr.cf file to adapt it to the context (`/etc/spamassassin/FuzzyOcr.cf`):

```perl
#loadplugin FuzzyOcr FuzzyOcr.pm
body FUZZY_OCR eval:fuzzyocr_check()
describe FUZZY_OCR Mail contains an image with common spam text inside
body FUZZY_OCR_WRONG_CTYPE eval:dummy_check()
describe FUZZY_OCR_WRONG_CTYPE Mail contains an image with wrong content-type set
body FUZZY_OCR_CORRUPT_IMG eval:dummy_check()
describe FUZZY_OCR_CORRUPT_IMG Mail contains a corrupted image
body FUZZY_OCR_KNOWN_HASH eval:dummy_check()
describe FUZZY_OCR_KNOWN_HASH Mail contains an image with known hash

Finally, we need to implement the configuration needed for logging:

```bash
touch /var/log/fuzzyocr.log
chown amavis.amavis /var/log/fuzzyocr.log
```

To limit the disk usage of the plugin's logging while maintaining a 90-day history, create a configuration file for the logrotate service. Create this file and insert the following lines (`/etc/logrotate.d/fuzzyocr`):

```
$ /etc/logrotate.d/fuzzyocr
/var/log/fuzzyocr.log {
    rotate 90
    daily
    compress
    delaycompress
    create 666 amavis amavis
    }
```

## Validation Tests

Before any manipulation, ensure that SpamAssassin is functioning correctly. The two commands:

```bash
spamassassin --lint
```

and

```bash
su - amavis -- spamassassin --lint
```

should not produce any output. If this is not the case, you should review your SpamAssassin or amavis configuration before testing the plugin's operation.

Next, use the spam samples provided with the plugin sources and analyze the results:

```bash
$ spamassassin -t /usr/local/src/FuzzyOcr-2.3b/samples/animated-gif.eml

```

We can see that the reports on the three tested samples show that keywords were detected in the images and that the scores were increased accordingly.

Now we just need to validate the solution in real operation! Without waiting, we get a sample that shows that optical character recognition added 18 points to the score.

Extract from the system log produced by the amavisd-new service:

## FAQ

### I still receive image-type spam, what should I do?

You should know that if the spam is very well camouflaged, detection will fail. But also check what the logs say. I had a problem with permissions at the log level. Make a small correction at that level if that's what's blocking things.
