## Introduction

You certainly know how that Varnish is a very good caching solution but the major problem is you can't use it for SSL connections. Fortunately there is a solution called "Offload SSL" which decrypt the SSL, send it to the cache system and return crypted flow. This schema will help you more on understanding the purpose of it:

![Offload SSL](../../../static/images/offload-ssl.avif)

How the thing goes?

- Let's start with the simplest thing: the non SSL traffic:

  1. The client requests data to the Varnish server:
     1. If Varnish has information -> it replies directly to the client
     2. If Varnish doesn't have information:
        1. It forwards connections to the Nginx in backend which reply to Varnish for caching
        2. Send back results to the client

- For the SSL traffic now:
  1. The client request data to the Nginx Frontend with SSL
  2. Nginx decrypt SSL traffic and forward the clear traffic to Varnish
  3. Varnish check it's cache and decide to forward to the Nginx backend if data is not in cache
     1. Nginx backend reply the required data to Varnish
  4. The data in Varnish are sent back to the Nginx Frontend for SSL reencapsulation
  5. Nginx Front end send the result to the client

Of course you don't need to have multiple machine to make it work. Here I'm using a single machine and a single Nginx instance listening on 2 different ports.

## Installation

You need to have of course Nginx PHP-FPM and Varnish installed:

```bash
aptitude install varnish nginx php5-fpm openssl
```

Then create SSL certificates or install yours:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
cd /etc/nginx/ssl
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
```

## Configuration

### Nginx

Regarding the Nginx configuration, here is the configuration for the Frontend (SSL) and the backend (8000) on the same Nginx instance:

``` apache hl_lines="4 34 41-42 20-30"
# SSL VirtualHost
server {
    # SSL Listen port
    listen 443 ssl;
    # Certificates
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;

    # Resumption
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    # Timeout
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;

    # Security options
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-RC4-SHA:ECDH-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:RC4-SHA;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    server_name vhost.deimos.fr;

    # Proxy Pass to Varnish
    # Add headers to recognize SSL
    location / {
        proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 443;
        proxy_set_header X-Secure on;
    }
}

# Clear VirtualHost
server {
    listen 8000;

    server_name vhost.deimos.fr;
    root /usr/share/nginx/www/test;
    index index.php;

    set_real_ip_from   127.0.0.1;
    real_ip_header     X-Forwarded-For;
    real_ip_recursive on;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/vhost.deimos.fr_access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/vhost.deimos.fr_error.log;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
    }
}
```

### Varnish

First of all, change the configuration to have a cache RAM and listen on 80 port:

``` bash hl_lines="5 6"
...
# Should we start varnishd at boot?  Set to "yes" to enable.
START=yes
[...]
DAEMON_OPTS="-a :80 \
             -b localhost:8000 \
             -S /etc/varnish/secret \
             -p thread_pools=2 \
             -p thread_pool_min=100 \
             -p thread_pool_max=2000 \
             -p thread_pool_add_delay=2 \
             -p session_linger=50 \
             -s malloc,512m"
[...]
```

Then configure the forward to the Nginx backend and elements to cache:

``` apache hl_lines="8-12 20-33 41-45 133-145"
# This is a basic VCL configuration file for varnish.  See the vcl(7)
# man page for details on VCL syntax and semantics.
#
# Default backend definition.  Set this to point to your content
# server.
#

# Redirect to Nginx Backend if not in cache
backend default {
    .host = "127.0.0.1";
    .port = "8000";
}

acl purge {
    "127.0.0.1";
}

# vcl_recv is called whenever a request is received
sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.restarts == 0) {
        if (req.http.x-forwarded-for) {
            set req.http.X-Forwarded-For =
                req.http.X-Forwarded-For + ", " + client.ip;
        } else {
            set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
        }
    }

    if (req.http.X-Real-IP) {
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = req.http.X-Real-IP;
    } else {
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
    }

# Serve objects up to 2 minutes past their expiry if the backend
# is slow to respond.
    set req.grace = 120s;

    set req.backend = default;

    if (!req.http.X-Forwarded-Proto) {
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-Proto = "http";
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-Port = "80";
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-Host = req.http.host;
    }


# This uses the ACL action called "purge". Basically if a request to
# PURGE the cache comes from anywhere other than localhost, ignore it.
    if (req.request == "PURGE")
    {if (!client.ip ~ purge)
        {error 405 "Not allowed.";}
        return(lookup);}

# Pass any requests that Varnish does not understand straight to the backend.
    if (req.request != "GET" && req.request != "HEAD" &&
            req.request != "PUT" && req.request != "POST" &&
            req.request != "TRACE" && req.request != "OPTIONS" &&

    {return(pipe);}     /* Non-RFC2616 or CONNECT which is weird. */

# Pass anything other than GET and HEAD directly.
    if (req.request != "GET" && req.request != "HEAD")
    {return(pass);}      /* We only deal with GET and HEAD by default */

# Pass requests from logged-in users directly.
    if (req.http.Authorization || req.http.Cookie)
    {return(pass);}      /* Not cacheable by default */

# Pass any requests with the "If-None-Match" header directly.
    if (req.http.If-None-Match)
    {return(pass);}

# Force lookup if the request is a no-cache request from the client.
    if (req.http.Cache-Control ~ "no-cache")
    {ban_url(req.url);}
    return(lookup);
}

sub vcl_pipe {
# This is otherwise not necessary if you do not do any request rewriting.
    set req.http.connection = "close";
}

# Called if the cache has a copy of the page.

}

sub vcl_fetch {

    if (beresp.ttl < 48h) {
        set beresp.ttl = 48h;}

    if (!beresp.ttl > 0s)
    {return(hit_for_pass);}

    if (beresp.http.Set-Cookie)
    {return(hit_for_pass);}

    if (req.http.Authorization && !beresp.http.Cache-Control ~ "public")
    {return(hit_for_pass);}
}

sub vcl_pass {
    return (pass);
}

sub vcl_hash {
    hash_data(req.url);
    if (req.http.host) {

## Testing

The testing part is should be applied in the good order. For my personal usages, I waste too much time because I didn't made the proper checks before. The things to check should be in that order:

1. Check Nginx backend on port 8000
2. Check Varnish access on port 80
3. Check SSL Nginx frontend on port 443

Add this index in your vhost server to get your header informations directly on the page:

```php
<?php
echo "Show all headers :\n";
foreach($_SERVER as $h=>$v)
 if(ereg('HTTP_(.+)',$h,$hp))
   echo "<li>$h = $v</li>\n";
header('Content-type: text/html');
?>
```

To test it you can use curl:

```bash
> curl -I http://url
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Last-Modified: Tue, 07 Jan 2014 10:40:39 GMT
Expires: Tue, 07 Jan 2014 11:40:39 GMT
Pragma: public

Etag: db7025811efc180e605972eb57550b68
X-Powered-By: W3 Total Cache/0.9.3

X-Varnish: 964417199 964417198
Age: 4
Via: 1.1 varnish
Connection: keep-alive
```

Use wget:

```bash
> wget -SS http://url
HTTP request sent, awaiting response...
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: nginx
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
  Last-Modified: Tue, 07 Jan 2014 10:40:39 GMT

  Etag: db7025811efc180e605972eb57550b68
  X-Powered-By: W3 Total Cache/0.9.3
  Vary: Accept-Encoding
  X-Pingback: http://url
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2014 10:57:22 GMT
  X-Varnish: 964417220 964417198
  Age: 63
  Via: 1.1 varnish
  Connection: keep-alive
Length: unspecified [text/html]
```

Or you can also use [LiveHTTPHeader Firefox extension](https://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/) to see headers. Now press keyboard:

- Ctrl+r: to reload the page (the second try should be cached)
- Ctrl+Shift+r: to reload the page asking the server to not deliver cached informations

If you try to access in https, you should get something like that:

```
Show all headers :
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST = test.deimos.fr
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO = https
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT = 443
HTTP_HOST = 127.0.0.1
HTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0
HTTP_ACCEPT = text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE = fr,fr-fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING = gzip, deflate
HTTP_COOKIE = _pk_id.1.5a2c=dfe5af08663a76b5.1388449087.3.1389005232.1388454622.; __qca=P0-1050834221-1388449087452; __cfduid=daa3baabbe79eb123b50f511c058dd29c1389819921950
HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL = max-age=0
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR = 222.2.20.132, 127.0.0.1
HTTP_X_VARNISH = 1929521662
```
