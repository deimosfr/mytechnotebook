## Introduction

The NTP server is a time server. It provides time based on atomic clock references.

## Installation

### Debian

Super quick:

```bash
apt-get install ntp
```

### Solaris

On Solaris, NTP is normally installed by default. Otherwise, search for packages containing *ntpd*.
You will need to copy the server configuration file:

```bash
cp /etc/inet/ntp.server /etc/inet/ntp.conf
```

## Configuration

Here is some information before diving into configuration files:

* stratum: indicates that it's not very reliable data
* 127.127.1.0: time given by the machine (BIOS)
* peer: defines a server of the same stratum as the server (same level/same geographic location), which allows for more reliability. Using 1 server + peers provides a more refined configuration than having only geographically distant servers.

### Debian

Here's the configuration file for a time server (`/etc/inet/ntp.conf`):

```bash
# /etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd

# ntpd will use syslog() if logfile is not defined
logfile /var/log/ntpd

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift
statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/

statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats
filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable
filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable
filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable
# Servers to use to update
server 0.fr.pool.ntp.org prefer
server 1.fr.pool.ntp.org
server 2.fr.pool.ntp.org

# ... and use the local system clock as a reference if all else fails
server 127.127.1.0
# fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 13

# Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely.
restrict 127.0.0.1

# Allow local network to synchronize to this server
restrict 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

broadcastdelay 0.008
```

After configuring and restarting the service, **you must wait a few minutes for the server to synchronize**.

### Solaris

Here's the configuration file for Solaris (`/etc/inet/ntp.conf`):

```bash

#
# An example file that could be copied over to /etc/inet/ntp.conf and
# edited; it provides a configuration template for a server that
# listens to an external hardware clock, synchronizes the local clock,
# and announces itself on the NTP multicast net.
#

# This is the external clock device.  The following devices are
# recognized by xntpd 3-5.93e:

Create a drift file as indicated in the configuration:

```bash
touch /etc/inet/ntp.drift
```

Then enable the service:

```bash
svcadm enable svc:/network/ntp:default
```

## NTP Clients

### Linux

To synchronize a Unix/Linux machine, use this command:

```bash
ntpdate my_time_server
```

### Solaris

It's quite simple on Solaris:

```bash
cp /etc/inet/ntp.client /etc/inet/ntp.conf
svcadm enable svc:/network/ntp:default
```

### Windows

From a Windows machine:

```bash
net time /setsntp:my_time_server
net time /querysntp
net stop w32time && net start w32time
```

## FAQ

### How to change the timezone?

On Debian, there's the **tzconfig** command! It's very practical:

```bash
tzconfig
```

If this doesn't work, try:

```bash
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

### "no server suitable for synchronization found"

If you encounter this error, there could be two reasons:

* Your NTP server needs to synchronize before it can provide time to other servers. This can sometimes take some time (~30 min).
* One of the servers in your list is unreachable, which makes your server unavailable for updates. Comment it out temporarily.

Once the following line appears in the logs ("clock is now synced"), everything is OK:

```
May 24 16:48:05 chronos ntpd[14262]: ntp engine ready
May 24 16:48:24 chronos ntpd[14262]: peer 91.121.45.45 now valid
May 24 16:48:24 chronos ntpd[14262]: peer 81.93.183.116 now valid
May 24 16:48:27 chronos ntpd[14262]: peer 94.23.220.143 now valid
May 24 17:27:13 chronos ntpd[14262]: clock is now synced
```
