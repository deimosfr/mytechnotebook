## Introduction

We will discuss two topics here:

- Device mappers
- Multipathing

We need to understand how device mappers work before tackling multipathing, which is why there will be an explanation of both in this documentation.

In the Linux kernel, the device mapper serves as a generic framework for mapping one block device ("mapping" the device) to another. It is the foundation for LVM2 and EVMS, software RAIDs, or disk encryption; and offers additional features such as file system snapshots.
The device mapper works by processing data transferred to it by a virtual block device (provided by itself), and passing the resulting data to another block device.

Multipathing allows you to have multiple paths to access the same data. This aims to increase data access capabilities if the storage equipment allows it (active/active) and to ensure redundancy in case of equipment failure, such as a controller. Here is what a multipath architecture looks like:

![Multipath](../../../static/images/multipath.avif)

It also works very well with a single SAN.

## Device Mapper

Device mappers are rarely used manually. They are generally used by higher layers such as LVM. Nevertheless, we'll see how to use them.

To add a partition in device mapper:

```bash
dmsetup create <device> <map_table>
```

- device: name of the device to create
- map_table: a file that must contain mapping rules, for example:

```bash
0 409600 linear /dev/sdal 0
409600 2048000 linear /dev/sda2 0
```

If I want to create a device mapper, I can also do it in a single command line without a file:

```bash
echo "0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/sda1` linear /dev/sda1 0" | dmsetup create mynewdm
```

There are several types of mapping targets:

- linear: continuous allocation
- stripped: segmented allocation between all devices
- error: to generate errors (ideal for development and testing)
- snapshot - copy-on-write device
- snapshot-origin: mapping to an original volume
- zero - sparse block devices (equivalent to /dev/null)
- multipath: multiple routes for connection to a device

To see all available device mappers:

```bash
> dmsetup table
myvg-rootvol: 0 10092544 linear 8:3 2048
```

To delete a device mapper:

```bash
dmsetup remove <disk>
```

To list all device mappers as a tree:

```bash
dmsetup ls --tree
```

## Multipathing

### Installation

Multipath is not installed by default, so we need to install a package:

```bash
yum install device-mapper-multipath
```

Then we will load the modules and make the service persistent:

```bash
modprobe dm_multipath
modprobe dm-round-robin
chkconfig multipathd on
```

### Configuration

If you don't have a configuration file, get one from the documentation:

```bash
cp /usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9/multipath.conf /etc/
```

Multipath uses a group notion ranging from 0 to 1024 (from highest to lowest priority). Only one group is active at a time. A group can contain multiple paths.

Let's proceed with configuring our multipathing service (I'm only showing the essential lines):

```bash
...
# Blacklist all devices by default. Remove this to enable multipathing
# on the default devices.
#blacklist {
#        devnode "*"
#}
## Use user friendly names, instead of using WWIDs as names.
defaults {
        user_friendly_names yes
}
##
## Here is an example of how to configure some standard options.
##
#
defaults {
        udev_dir                /dev
        polling_interval        10
        selector                "round-robin 0"
        path_grouping_policy    multibus
        getuid_callout          "/lib/udev/scsi_id --whitelisted --device=/dev/%n"
        prio                    alua
        path_checker            readsector0
        rr_min_io               100
        max_fds                 8192
        rr_weight               priorities
        failback                immediate
        no_path_retry           fail
        user_friendly_names     yes
}
blacklist {
       wwid 26353900f02796769
       devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
       devnode "^hd[a-z]"
}
...
```

I strongly recommend checking the man pages for the options above.

We can now start our service:

```bash
service multipathd start
```

### Usage

Here is the order and tools to use for disk detection, this section is very important:

1. **Devices: partprobe /dev/<device> (e.g., sda)**
2. **Device-mappers: kpartx -a /dev/<device-mapper> (e.g., dm-1)**
3. **Multipath: partprobe /dev/mapper/<multipath> (e.g., mpath0)**

To see active paths:

```bash
multipath -l
```

To create partitions on a multipathed device mapper, you **must** do it on the underlying disk (e.g., /dev/sda) and not on the multipathed device mapper! So the procedure is to create your partition with fdisk for example, then detect your new partition:

```bash
partprobe /dev/sda
partprobe /dev/sdb
kpartx -a /dev/mapper/mpath0
```

## FAQ

### I still don't see my new LUNs, how do I refresh them?

It is possible that creating new LUNs/partitions requires a new scan to detect them. We will need this package:

```bash
yum install sg3_utils
```

Then let's launch the scan:

```bash
rescan-scsi-bus.sh
```

Or alternatively, we can do it directly with /proc:

- If it's on a SCSI type platform:

```bash
echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/<HBA>/scan
```

- If it's for a Fiber Channel array:

```bash
echo "1" > /sys/class/fc_host/<HBA>/issue_lip
echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/<HBA>/scan
```

### I can't see my new partition correctly, how should I proceed?

Here's how to proceed when encountering an issue while creating a partition on a multipath. Let's take this example:

- I don't see mpath0p2 on one machine, whereas I can see it on other machines:

```bash
> ls /dev/mpath/
mpath0  mpath0p1
```

- I verify that I can see my partition on both paths (sda2 and sdb2):

```bash
> fdisk -l

Disk /dev/dm-2 doesn't contain a valid partition table
```

Make sure there are no blacklist options in the configuration preventing you from properly seeing the devices. To do this, we'll comment out all blacklist parts:

```bash
#blacklist {
#       wwid 26353900f02796769
#       devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
#       devnode "^hd[a-z]"
#}
```

- We see that /dev/dm-1p1 is present, but not the 2nd one (at least there's an error). I check again that there is no presence of my dm-2:

```bash
> ls -l /dev/dm-1
brw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 1 Mar  1 13:42 /dev/dm-1
```

```bash
> ls -l /dev/mapper/
total 0
crw------- 1 root root  10, 62 Mar  1 13:41 control
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 253,  1 Mar  1 13:42 mpath0
brw-rw---- 1 root root 253,  2 Mar  1 14:06 mpath0p1
brw------- 1 root root 253,  0 Mar  1 13:41 myvg0-mylv0
```

- We see that "253, 1" corresponds to /dev/dm-1. We'll do a kpartx and partprobe on both to refresh the paths:

```bash
kpartx -a /dev/dm-1
kpartx -a /dev/dm-2
partprobe /dev/mapper/mpath0
```

Even if you get errors like:

```
device-mapper: create ioctl failed: Device or resource busy
```

It's not serious, it allows it to refresh the list of device mappers.

- And now it works:

``` bash hl_lines="6"
> ls -l /dev/mapper/
total 0
crw------- 1 root root  10, 62 Mar  1 13:41 control
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 253,  1 Mar  1 13:42 mpath0
brw-rw---- 1 root root 253,  2 Mar  1 14:06 mpath0p1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 253,  3 Mar  1 14:19 mpath0p2
brw------- 1 root root 253,  0 Mar  1 13:41 myvg0-mylv0
```
