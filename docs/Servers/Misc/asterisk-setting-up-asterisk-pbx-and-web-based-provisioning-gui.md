## Introduction

[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) is open-source software that transforms a computer into a private telephone exchange or PABX. Asterisk is published under the GPL license.

Asterisk allows, among other things, voicemail, conferencing, voice servers, and call distribution. Asterisk implements the H.323 and SIP protocols, as well as a specific protocol called IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange). This IAX protocol enables communication between two Asterisk servers as well as between Asterisk client and server. Asterisk can also act as a registrar and gateway with public networks (PSTN, GSM, etc.).

Asterisk is extensible through scripts or modules in Perl, C, Python, PHP...
