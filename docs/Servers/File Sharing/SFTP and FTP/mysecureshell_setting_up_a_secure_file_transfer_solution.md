## Introduction

It was about time this documentation arrived! Although I am one of the founders and developers of [MySecureShell](https://mysecureshell.sourceforge.net), creating a quick and simpler guide than the one on the website was a bit daunting. But I finally found this magnificent documentation.

For those who don't know, MySecureShell is a server that relies on OpenSSH to provide ACLs similar to those on a classic FTP server. The advantage is security!

Additionally, there's a Java interface to manage everything for those who want it.
