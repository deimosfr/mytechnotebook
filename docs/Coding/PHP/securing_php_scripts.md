PHP is a powerful language that allows you to do almost anything. It's therefore easy to create security vulnerabilities. That's why I'm offering this documentation to help you avoid making mistakes:

[Documentation on PHP security](../../static/pdf/sec_scripts_php.pdf)  
[Intrusion Detection For PHP Applications With PHPIDS](../../static/pdf/intrusion_detection_for_php_applications_with_phpids.pdf)
