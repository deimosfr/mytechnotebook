You might want to have multiple email addresses without having multiple accounts. For example, one address for your newsletters, one disposable address, and so on.

You can use the "+" sign to accomplish this, for example:

- youremail@gmail.com: your main address
- youremail+trash@gmail.com: your disposable address
- youremail+newsletters@gmail.com: your address for newsletters

This gives you multiple addresses, but all emails will arrive in the same inbox. You can then create filtering rules to sort them into specific folders for automated organization.

Happy emailing! :-)
