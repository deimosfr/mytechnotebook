## Introduction

Installing old Debian to prepare a migration is quite good when repositories are still available. But for old unmaintained versions of Debian, we need to change some things.

This is what we're gonna look here.

## Usage

For this example, we're going to take lenny version which is totally deprecated. To make repository work, we need to change the repository url by 'archives':

```bash
# /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ lenny main non-free contrib
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian/ lenny main non-free contrib
# Volatile:
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
# Backports:
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main contrib non-free
# Previously announced security updates:
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security lenny/updates main
```

That's all, you can update.
