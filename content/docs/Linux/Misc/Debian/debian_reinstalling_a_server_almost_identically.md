## Principle

From a reference server, I want to quickly install another server with exactly the same packages.

## Usage

We'll extract the list of installed packages from the reference server:

```bash
dpkg --get-selections > my_packages.txt
```

Then reinstall everything from this package list:

```bash
dpkg --clear-selections
dpkg --set-selections < my_packages.txt
apt-get update
apt-get dselect-upgrade
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get upgrade
```
