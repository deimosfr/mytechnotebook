## Introduction

Since Ubuntu 8.10, I had lost a small functionality - the ability to paste from clipboard using the left button representing a down arrow on a Logitech MX Revolution mouse.

## Solution

Use xmodmap to map all the possibilities of your mouse:

```bash
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 8 3 4 5 6 7 2 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32"
```

You can also use BTNX if you want to assign certain buttons to specific applications or simply standard actions.
