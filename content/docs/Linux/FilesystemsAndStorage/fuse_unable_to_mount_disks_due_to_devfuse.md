I once encountered this problem. I didn't look into it for long, but it's quite annoying, and the worst part is that I don't have an explanation for it.

After a reboot, I got an error message saying that FUSE could not mount my encrypted disks because "/dev/fuse" did not allow it.

Indeed, the device file didn't exist, which is why I had to run this command to recreate it:

```bash
sudo mknod /dev/fuse -m 0666 c 10 229
```
