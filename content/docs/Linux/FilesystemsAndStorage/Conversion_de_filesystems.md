## Introduction

Sometimes you need to convert your filesystem to a more recent one when possible, without having to reformat everything.

## EXT3 -> EXT4

It's obvious that the partition to be converted must be unmounted beforehand. Here, I'll use an LVM partition in ext3 to convert it to ext4:

```bash
tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/mapper/lvm-home
fsck -pf /dev/mapper/lvm-home
```

If you're modifying the boot partition, you need to boot from a live CD for example, then run this command to revalidate grub:

```bash
grub-install /dev/sda
```
