## Introduction

Smartmontools is a tool for analyzing hard drives and their most critical physical characteristics. It consists of two parts: smartd daemon, which checks parameters every 30 minutes and writes the results to `/var/log/syslog`, and the smartctl command which requires root privileges and is used to display all the information.

## Activation / Installation of smartmontools

### Debian

Installation requires root privileges. The package name varies depending on your Debian version. The example below is for Sarge.

```bash
> aptitude install smartmontools

Parametrage de smartmontools (5.32-3) ...
Not starting S.M.A.R.T. daemon smartd, disabled via /etc/default/smartmontools
```

As you can see, the daemon has not been started immediately. You need to edit `/etc/default/smartmontools` and uncomment the lines `start_smartd=yes` and `smartd_opts="--interval=1800"`:

```bash
# Defaults for smartmontools initscript (/etc/init.d/smartmontools)
# This is a POSIX shell fragment

# list of devices you want to explicitly enable S.M.A.R.T. for
# not needed if the device is monitored by smartd
# enable_smart="/dev/hda /dev/hdb"

# uncomment to start smartd on system startup
start_smartd=yes

# uncomment to pass additional options to smartd on startup
smartd_opts="--interval=1800"
```

Once the changes are validated, start the daemon:

```bash
/etc/init.d/smartmontools start
Enabling S.M.A.R.T. for: /dev/hda /dev/hdb.
Starting S.M.A.R.T. daemon: smartd.
23:21 root@revolution /# smartctl -a /dev/hda
smartctl version 5.32 Copyright (C) 2002-4 Bruce Allen
```

The smartd daemon will now regularly check your disk information and record it in your logs:

```bash
cat /var/log/syslog | grep smartd
Mar 17 10:48:34 slut smartd[990]: Configuration file /etc/smartd.conf was parsed, found DEVICESCAN, scanning devices
```

And there you go, it's ready.

### FreeBSD

To install smartmontools:

```bash
pkg_add -r smartmontool
```

Then start it like this:

```bash
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/smartd start
```

Edit the `/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf` configuration and add this line (adapting to your email):

```bash
DEVICESCAN -a -m my@mail.com
```

Next, if we want smartd to start at every boot, add this line:

```bash
smartd_enable="YES"
```

## Fine Tuning

### Debian

To fine-tune the smartmontools configuration, edit the `/etc/smartd.conf` file and look for the DEVICESCAN line to add your own settings, as in this example:

```bash
DEVICESCAN -H -l error -l selftest -t -f -m admin@webank.fr -M exec /usr/bin/mail -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
```

The DEVICESCAN directive indicates that you want to apply this configuration to all hard disks detected as SMART compatible on the system. It can be replaced by the name of a device `/dev/hdx` or `/dev/sdx`.

```bash
/dev/hda -H -l error -l selftest -t -f -m admin@webank.fr -M exec /usr/bin/mail -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
/dev/hdc -H -l error -l selftest -t -f -m admin@webank.fr -M exec /usr/bin/mail -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
```

Adding this line to the configuration file allows sending an email to admin@domain.com using your system's mail command. The -t option indicates that we want to be informed in case the "Pre-Fail" or "Old-age" attribute shows errors, if the health test (option -H) fails, or if the error and selftest logs evolve (-l). You can choose from a range of options to best adjust according to your needs. For example, you can deliberately ignore an attribute using the -I option. Adding the -I 194 option indicates that we want to receive an email in case of failure but ignoring attribute number 194 (temperature). The -s option allows you to define the periodicity of the tests to be performed (version >5.30 required). In this example, we perform a short test (S/) every day at 2 a.m., and a long test every Saturday at 3 a.m. It's also possible to modify the email that will be sent by smartd in case of failure by creating a script that will be called instead of /bin/mail.

### FreeBSD

To receive daily emails indicating the state of your disks, add this to the `/etc/periodic.conf` file:

```bash
daily_status_smart_devices="/dev/ad4 /dev/ad6 /dev/ad8 /dev/ad10 /dev/ad12"
```

Obviously, use your own devices.

## Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

Since smartd writes to `/var/log/syslog`, it's easy to search with a grep command as in the following example:

```bash
> grep smartd /var/log/syslog
Mar 17 10:48:34 slut smartd[990]: Configuration file /etc/smartd.conf was parsed, found DEVICESCAN, scanning devices
Mar 17 10:48:34 slut smartd[990]: Device: /dev/hda, opened
Mar 17 10:48:34 slut smartd[990]: Device: /dev/hda, found in smartd database.
Mar 17 10:48:35 slut smartd[990]: Device: /dev/hda, is SMART capable. Adding to "monitor" list.
Mar 17 10:48:35 slut smartd[990]: Device: /dev/hdb, opened
Mar 17 10:48:35 slut smartd[990]: Device: /dev/hdb, not ATA, no IDENTIFY DEVICE Structure
Mar 17 10:48:35 slut smartd[990]: Monitoring 1 ATA and 0 SCSI devices
Mar 17 10:48:35 slut smartd: Lancement smartd succeeded
Mar 17 10:48:35 slut smartd[2421]: smartd has fork()ed into background mode. New PID=2421.
Mar 17 13:48:35 slut smartd[2421]: Device: /dev/hda, SMART Prefailure Attribute: 8 Seek_Time_Performance changed from 246 to 247
Mar 17 15:48:35 slut smartd[2421]: Device: /dev/hda, SMART Prefailure Attribute: 8 Seek_Time_Performance changed from 247 to 246
Mar 17 17:18:35 slut smartd[2421]: Device: /dev/hda, SMART Prefailure Attribute: 8 Seek_Time_Performance changed from 246 to 247
```

How to interpret these lines? The drive shows a constant value that varies between 246 and 247. If the value suddenly changes from 247 to 500, this is abnormal behavior.

Using the smartctl command requires root privileges. Let's look at the different attributes of the command.

```bash
smarctl -h

```

Now we need to interpret the information such as disk uptime, temperature, and most importantly for us, errors. For this we mainly observe the last two columns: WHEN_FAILED and RAW_VALUE, and the section just below: SMART Error Log Version: 1 No Errors Logged.

An example:

```
5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct 0x0033 016 016 063 Pre-fail Always FAILING_NOW 598
```

Here we see that sector reallocation has failed. You should therefore monitor this part. If the number indicated quickly increases to higher figures, take the necessary measures: back up your data and possibly contact support.

## Conclusion

Smartmontools is simple to use and very comprehensive. Note, however, that such a tool does not replace the most important thing: regular backup of your data.

## FAQ

### Problems during updates

Sometimes during a package update, things may go wrong and you may not know why. The problem is actually quite simple. Just stop the service:

```bash
/etc/init.d/smartmontool stop
```

then restart the update.

### The service won't start

This problem can occur when SMART is simply not enabled. To enable it, just type this command:

```bash
smartctl -s on /dev/sda
```

Then try to start smartmontools:

```bash
/etc/init.d/smartmontools start
```
