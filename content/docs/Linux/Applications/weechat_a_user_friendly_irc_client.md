## Introduction

WeeChat is a fast, light and extensible chat client. It runs on many platforms (including Linux, BSD and Mac OS).

WeeChat is:

- modular: a lightweight core with plugins around
- multi-protocols: IRC and Jabber (other soon)
- extensible: C plugins and scripts (Perl, Python, Ruby, Lua, Tcl and Scheme)
- free software: released under GPLv3 license
- fully documented: user's guide, API, FAQ,.. translated in many languages

Development is very active, and bug fixes are very fast!

## Installation

The installation part is really easy:

```bash
aptitude install weechat-curses
```

To launch it:

```bash
weechat-ncurses
```

## Configuration

### Freenode configuration

If you want to store your freenode configuration, edit and adapt this configuration file (`~/.weechat/irc.conf`):

```bash
[server_default]
[...]
nicks = "username1,username2,username3"
password = "pass"
realname = "realname"
username = "username"
[...]
```

### Autoconnect to channels

If you want to autoconnect to a specific channel (`~/.weechat/irc.conf`):

```bash
[server_default]
[...]
autoconnect = on
autojoin = "#channel1,#channel2"
[...]
```

And if channel 1 requires a password for instance (`~/.weechat/irc.conf`):

```bash
[server_default]
[...]
autoconnect = on
autojoin = "#channel1,#channel2 password"
[...]
```
