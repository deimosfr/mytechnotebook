As you've probably noticed, there are some services like SSH that don't have a simple solution to stop the service.

That's why I'm giving you this solution. For example with SSH, if I want to restart it:

```bash
kill -HUP `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`
```

It's as simple as that. Now you can manually restart it:

```bash
/usr/sbin/sshd
```
