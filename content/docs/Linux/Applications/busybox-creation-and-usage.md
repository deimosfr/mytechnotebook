## Introduction

[BusyBox](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busybox) is a software that implements a large number of standard Unix commands, similar to GNU Core Utilities. BusyBox is designed as a single executable file, making it very suitable for Linux distributions used on embedded systems. Since each binary executable file for Linux contains several kilobytes of additional information, the idea of combining more than two hundred programs into a single executable file allows for considerable space savings.

Distributed under the GNU GPL version 2 license, BusyBox is free software.

At the end of 2007, BusyBox attracted attention for its legal efforts to pursue and enforce its rights against certain companies that would use it in violation of the terms of the GPL license.

Indeed, this system remains one of the most widespread on network devices. It can be found, for example, on access points, routers, or even on some NAS (Network Attached Storage). Generally, you can access this device via telnet, which allows more freedom and creativity for its configuration.
