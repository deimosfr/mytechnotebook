## Introduction

It's not always easy to start with a programming language, especially when you've never studied it in school! That's why I'm offering some small scripts I made right after going through some books. These scripts should increase in difficulty as you go along.

## PS, Java and XMX

For work, I had to create a script for Solaris that lists users, PIDs, launch dates for Java processes, and some other information. The goal was to display XMX values without the entire Java command inserted, or other unnecessary information for the people who were going to use this script. Here is my first Perl script:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
## Java Status Script for Solaris ##
## Made by Pierre Mavro ##

use strict;

my $line;
my $ups;

print "\n############## Bridge Status ##############\n\n";
print "  USER\t   PID\t%MEM   TIME  XMX\n";

open FILE, "ps -edfo user,pid,pmem,stime,args \| grep java \| grep -v grep |";

while ($line = <FILE>){
        if ($line =~ /^(.*[_|:]\d+).*/) {
                $ups = $1; 
                if ($line =~ /.*-Xmx(\d+)/) {
                        print "$ups $1M\n";
                } else {
                        print "$ups NO XMX DEFINED\n";
                }
        }
}

close FILE;
print "\n"
```

## Creating SFTP User Accounts

This script was designed to create and delete SFTP user accounts. It then sends an email to the admin, and copies to the concerned person. There is also automatic password generation.

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
## SFTP Mangament Script ##
## Made by Pierre Mavro ##

## Needed componants
# - apg
# - Perl "Mail::Sender::Easy" module

use strict;

# Load Modules
use Mail::Sender::Easy qw(email);

die "USAGE: manage_sftp_user.pl [create|delete] username login(\@mycompany.com of the consultant mail)\n" if ($ARGV[0] !~ /(create|delete|remove)/);

my $create_account;

my $crypted_pass;
my $user_login = $ARGV[1];
my $mail_cc = $ARGV[2];

# Functions

        system "rm", "-Rf", "/home/clients/$user_login";
    }   
}

sub user_add {
    if ($ARGV[1]) {
        # Check if user exist

            open (FILER, "<$radius_user_files") || die("Can't open file: $!");
                while (<FILER>) {
                if ($_ =~ /^(\w+).+Auth-Type.+".*"/) {
                    if ($1 eq $ARGV[1]) {
                      die("Sorry but user already exist\n");
                    }
                }
            }
            close (FILER);
            # Generate password
            $password = `$apg_exec -a0 -n1 -x10 -m10 -MCN`;
            chomp $password;
            # Write to raddius files
            open (FILEW, ">>$radius_user_files") || die("Can't write file: $!");
            printf FILEW "%-15s", "$ARGV[1]";
            print FILEW "\t\tAuth-Type := Local, User-Password == \"$password\"\n";
            print FILEW "\t\t\tFilter-Id = \"vpnhome\"\n\n";
            close (FILEW);
            # Push to arrays for sending mails
            $user_pass_id = 0;
            push @tab_users, $ARGV[1];
            push @tab_pass, $password;
        }
    } else {
        &help;
    }
}

sub send_mail {
    # Just a verification to be sure that the username folder has been created
    if ( -d "/home/clients/$user_login" ) { 
        email({

## Controlling the Number of Users for MySecureShell

As one of the founders of MySecureShell, I had to create scripts for Nagios agents. Here's a script to monitor the number of users compared to the maximum:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# Usage: check_mss_users ([warn] [critical] are optionals)
#
# Nagios script to check MySecureShell users (can be checked only on MySecureShell server)
#
# Made by Pierre Mavro / MySecureShell Team

use strict;

#### Vars can be touched ####
my $sftp_who = "/usr/bin/sftp-who"; # sftp-who binary

#### Do not edit now ####
my $warn_mss_users = $ARGV[0] or 0.75; # warning MySecureShell users or using 75% by default
my $crit_mss_users = $ARGV[1] or 0.90; # critical MySecureShell users or using 90% by default
my $max_mss_users;
my $curr_mss_users;

sub get_infos {
        # Check config file and read config file to check LimitConnection value
        open (SFTP_WHO, "$sftp_who |") or die "Couldn't execute $sftp_who binary: $!\n";
        while (my $line = <SFTP_WHO>) {
                # Find the currently and maximum connected users
                if ($line =~ /^---.(d+).\/.(\d+).clients/) {
                        $curr_mss_users = $1; 
                        $max_mss_users = $2; 
                }
        }
        close SFTP_WHO;
}

sub check {
        if ($curr_mss_users < $warn_mss_users) {
                print "USERS OK - currently connected $curr_mss_users / $max_mss_users |users=$curr_mss_users;$warn_mss_users;$crit_mss_users\n";
                exit(0);
        } elsif ($curr_mss_users < $crit_mss_users) {
                print "USERS WARNING - currently connected $curr_mss_users / $max_mss_users\n";
                exit(1);
        } else {
                print "USERS CRITICAL - currently connected $curr_mss_users / $max_mss_users\n";
                exit(2);
        }
}

# If the twice values are defined
if ((defined($warn_mss_users)) and (defined($crit_mss_users))) {
        &get_infos;
        &check;
# If only one value is defined
} elsif ((defined($warn_mss_users)) or (defined($crit_mss_users))) {
        print "Usage: check_mss_users ([warn] [critical] are optionals)\n";
        exit(-1);
# If no values are defined, defaults are used
} else {
        &get_infos;
        &check;
}
```

## Managing Freeradius Accounts

Here is a script that manages (add/delete) radius accounts. It also allows you to change passwords, remind users that their password will change by email, and resend credentials for forgetful people.

You can also list people with their credentials in a nice table and replicate to secondary radius servers via SSH.

For Radius to work correctly afterwards, you'll need to add this to `/etc/freeradius/users`:

```
 $INCLUDE  vpn_users
```

For the usage of this script, you'll need to add the script to crontab with:

- generate: to generate new passwords in a new file and send an email to each user
- reminder: to remind users that their password will change
- switch: to use the new file with the new credentials

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

## Multi-threading an MD5 Hash

Here's a simple example that can serve as a basis for a multi-threaded script. It calculates the MD5 hash of a list of files, which is rather trivial, but it's up to you to imagine what processing to perform.

What's interesting is:

- How threads are launched
- How threads lock the array, remove an element, then release it
- How threads are stopped

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use threads;
use threads::shared;
use Digest::MD5;

our $VERSION = 1.0;
our $SLASH = q{/};

# Getting command line arguments
my @arguments = @ARGV;
if (!$arguments[0])
{
    usage ();
}
my $directory = $arguments[0];
my $max_threads = 2;
if ($arguments[1] && $arguments[1] =~ /^\d{1,2}$/xm)
{
    $max_threads = $arguments[1];
}

# Getting regular files in the directory
my $DIR;
opendir $DIR , $directory or die "unable to opendir: $!\n";
my @files = grep { -f "$directory/$_" } readdir $DIR or die "unable to readdir: $!\n";
closedir $DIR or die "unable to closedir: $!\n";
my @tableau : shared = sort @files;

# Launching threads
my @threads;
for (1 .. $max_threads)
{
    my $thread = threads->create ('thread_code');
    push @threads , $thread;
}

# Waiting for the threads to finish
while (@threads)
{
    my $thread = shift @threads;
    $thread->join ();
}
print "fini\n" or die "unable to print: $!\n";
exit 0;

## SUN Cluster Script for Java Applications

For my work, I needed to create this kind of script. I won't go into details, but it optimally manages Java applications that lack cluster functions:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# Copyright (c) 2008 by mycompany, Inc.  All rights reserved.
# Use is subject to license terms.

# Sun Cluster Script v1.3

# Pierre Mavro @ mycompany
# Last modification: 27/01/2009 11:45

# Supported Sun Solaris cluster Versions:
# 3.0, 3.1, 3.2

###################################
#  How to use Sun Cluster script  #
###################################

# Requierements:
# - Syslog server on localhost (on each nodes)
# - Perl 5.8 or newer should be installed on the server
# - Perl Module Unix::Syslog (use cpan to install it and Sun Studio Express to compile with cc)

# To configure the SUN Cluster mycompany Service, you'll need to add this in the configuration:
# - Start : PATH_OF_THE_SCRIPT start
# - Stop  : PATH_OF_THE_SCRIPT stop
# - Status: PATH_OF_THE_SCRIPT status

# To configure this script, edit the User section.
# If you need advanced functions, edit the advanced user section (by default you needn't)
```
