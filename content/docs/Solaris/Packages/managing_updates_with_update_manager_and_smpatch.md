## Introduction

As I love Debian and some of my servers are running on Solaris, I had to get in touch with Solaris update solutions. They have a GUI called Solaris Update Manager and the CLI version called smpatch.

As it is on servers, I don't have a graphical interface and I need to run updates with command lines. That's what I'll specifically talk about in this documentation. List of interesting binaries:

- pprosetup: Used to set the rules for downloading and applying patches.
- pprosvc: The automation service program for Patch Manager.
- smpatch: Used to actually download, apply, and remove the patches specified on the command line.

## Update Manager

Just to give you a quick idea, when you have a graphical interface, it looks like this:

I won't explain how it works as it is very simple.

## smpatch

smpatch is the command line version of Update Manager.

### Configuration

#### Set proxy settings

```bash
smpatch set patchpro.proxy.host=fqdn_of_proxy_host
smpatch set patchpro.proxy.port=proxy_port
smpatch set patchpro.proxy.user=proxy_username_if_needed
```

Now set password by prompt:

```bash
smpatch set patchpro.proxy.passwd
```

#### Configuration files

Here are the configuration files:

- System defaults:
  - `/var/sadm/install/admin/default`
- PatchPro defaults:
  - `/etc/opt/SUNWppro/etc/patchpro.conf`
  - `/opt/SUNWppro/lib/.proxypw`
- SunSolve Account Options
  - `/etc/patch/patch.conf`
  - `/etc/patch/secret.conf`

### Analyze

The analyze will check what needs to be updated on your server:

```bash
$ smpatch analyze
122213-34 GNOME 2.6.0_x86: GNOME Desktop Patch
119901-09 GNOME 2.6.0_x86: Gnome libtiff - library for reading and writing TIFF Patch

```

### Upgrade

Now you want to upgrade. You have 2 choices:

- Automatic update: will check what is needed and will upgrade your system as well
- Manual update: you'll need to download them and install them afterward

#### Automatic

The automatic **update** will do everything on its own (download + install):

```bash
$ smpatch update
122213-34 has been validated.
119901-09 has been validated.
142293-01 has been validated.
141445-09 has been validated.
141031-05 has been validated.
...
```

That's all. It will tell you if it's necessary to reboot or not.

#### Manual

For the manual upgrade, you'll need first to download updates:

```bash
$ smpatch download
125534-15 has been validated.
126364-08 has been validated.
...
```

And then install them:

```bash
$ smpatch add
```

#### Default storage location

By default, updates are stored in this folder `/var/sadm/spool/`. Updates are in .jar format:

```bash
$ ls /var/sadm/spool/
118668-23.jar                              121431-43.jar                              125953-19.jar                              139100-02.jar                              141589-03.jar
118778-12.jar                              122213-34.jar                              125993-04.jar                              139621-01.jar                              141591-01.jar
119116-35.jar                              122260-02.jar                              126018-05.jar                              140018-03.jar                              141879-08.jar
119214-20.jar                              122471-03.jar                              126036-07.jar                              140130-10.jar                              142241-01.jar
