QEMU allows you to run one or more operating systems (and their applications) in isolation on the same physical machine. QEMU works on x86, x86-64, PPC, Sparc, and ARM platforms. QEMU runs under Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, Unix, and Windows operating systems.

QEMU is a free, reliable, and powerful virtualization tool. Guest operating systems share the resources of the physical machine.

QEMU is a "system emulator" or "virtual machine." Guest operating systems are not "aware" of the underlying QEMU - they don't need to be "ported" (adapted) to work on QEMU.

The Linux kernel module KQEMU (for Kernel QEMU) accelerates emulation on Linux operating systems.
