Here is documentation that requires good knowledge of [MySQL replications]({{< ref "docs/Servers/Databases/MySQL-MariaDB/mysql_installation_and_configuration.md" >}}) and [clustering]({{< ref "docs/Servers/Databases/MySQL-MariaDB/replication_master_to_master.md" >}}) techniques.

It can save you a lot of time even if you have the necessary knowledge:

[Documentation on a Load-Balanced MySQL Cluster With MySQL 5.1](/pdf/load-balanced_mysql_cluster_with_mysql_5_1.pdf)
