## Introduction

ZRM for MySQL is a powerful, flexible and robust backup and recovery solution for MySQL databases for all storage engines. With ZRM for MySQL a Database Administrator can automate logical or raw backup to a local or remote disk. In this How To, we attempt to explain how to recover from an user error at any given point in time.

## Our Scenario

At approximately 2:30pm there were 5 tablespaces added into the MovieID table. At 3pm you get a call from a user, who was trying to delete some unused tablespaces but ended up deleting the last 5 that he just added. The last full backup you performed was the night before at 7pm. How do you recover back to right before the last 5 tablespaces were deleted? In this case we will demonstrate a point in time restore.

### Note

* More information on ZRM for MySQL is available [here](https://www.zmanda.com/backup-mysql.html).
* To know more about configuring ZRM for MySQL you can look at [https://www.zmanda.com/quick-mysql-backup.html](https://www.zmanda.com/quick-mysql-backup.html).
* For this How To, we use [ZRM for MySQL version 1.1.1](https://www.zmanda.com/downloads.html#ZRM).
* To perform incremental backups the binary logging option must be turned on. Edit the `/etc/my.cnf` file and add the following line under the [mysqld] section:

```bash
log-bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.log
```

You will have restart your MySQL daemon before this goes into effect.

### Verifications

We will verify that the last full backup ran successfully last night:

```bash
$ mysql-zrm-reporter -show restore-info --where backup-set=dailyrun

backup_set backup_date backup_level backup_directory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dailyrun Wed 18 Oct 2006 07:07:08 PM PDT 0 /var/lib/mysql-zrm/dailyrun/20061018190708
```

We can see above that the last full did run successfully last night at 7:07pm.

### Backup

So now we will run an incremental backup manually to record all the changes between the last backup and now, by typing:

```bash
mysql-zrm-scheduler --now --backup-set dailyrun --backup-level 1
```

### Parsing logs

Next we will parse through the binary logs backed up in the last incremental backup

```bash
$ mysql-zrm --action parse-binlogs --source-directory /var/lib/mysql-zrm/dailyrun/20061019151937 --backup-set dailyrun

### Restoration

So now we will restore the database to what it looked like at approximately 2:45pm. Since the tables were added at 2:30pm and accidentally deleted at 3pm. Since we want the database back to the state it was at right before the delete.

```bash
$ mysql-zrm --action restore --source-directory /var/lib/mysql-zrm/dailyrun/20061019151937 --backup-set dailyrun --stop-datetime "20061019144500"

INFO: Incremental restore done for database movies

```

Once you restart the MySQL services you'll notice that the database has been restored to what it looked at 2:45pm. Which means it has the last 5 tablespaces that were accidentally deleted at 3pm.
