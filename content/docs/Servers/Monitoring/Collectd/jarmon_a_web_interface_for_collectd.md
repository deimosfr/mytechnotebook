## Introduction

Jarmon is another interface for Collectd. I like this one because it's clean and allows zooming. However, at the moment it only works on a host-by-host basis. This means that in the configuration, you need to specify a particular host.

## Installation

For the installation, we need a web server:

```bash
aptitude install apache2 bzr
```

## Configuration

Let's retrieve the source code:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/
cd /var/www
bzr branch lp:~richardw/jarmon/trunk
mv trunk jarmon
chown -Rf www-data. jarmon
cd jarmon
```

Now we create a symbolic link to the directory containing the RRD files of the machine we want to monitor:

```bash
ln -s /var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost data
```

Now you can access the web interface: http://collectd-server/jarmon
