## Introduction

Centreon is one of the most flexible and powerful GPL-licensed monitoring software solutions. It's built on top of the OpenSource Nagios technology.

Designed for a wide range of users, it's perfectly suited for measuring system, network, and application indicators. Centreon brings together essential functions for managing monitoring of critical infrastructures. Being modular, it adapts to your needs and allows you to extend its functionality further.

For my part, I chose to move from Nagios 3 to Centreon to get graphics and reporting capabilities.

The installation below is performed on Debian Lenny 64 bits.

## Installation

### LAMP

For the installation, we'll first install the prerequisites, namely a web server, mail server, and SQL (Apache2+PHP, postfix, mysql) as well as the necessary libraries to create graphs (rrdtool):

```bash
aptitude install sudo sysutils mailx lsb-release postfix build-essential apache2 apache2-mpm-prefork php5 php5-mysql php-pear php5-ldap php5-snmp php5-gd mysql-server-5.0 libmysqlclient15-dev rrdtool \
librrds-perl libconfig-inifiles-perl libcrypt-des-perl libdigest-hmac-perl libdigest-sha1-perl libgd-gd2-perl snmp snmpd libnet-snmp-perl libsnmp-perl libgd2-xpm libgd2-xpm-dev libpng12-dev 
```

### Nagios 3

Next, we'll install nagios3 and the plugins:

```bash
aptitude install nagios3 nagios3-common nagios3-doc nagios-plugins nagios-plugins-basic nagios-plugins-standard nagios-images dnsutils fping
```

Let's create the nagcmd group, then add nagios and nagcmd to www-data (apache2):

```bash
groupadd nagcmd
usermod -G nagios,nagcmd nagios
usermod -G nagios,nagcmd www-data
```

### NDOutils

Let's install NDOutils:

```bash
aptitude install ndoutils-nagios3-mysql ndoutils-common dbconfig-common
```

Let's activate it by setting the following value to 1:

```bash
ENABLE_NDOUTILS=1
```

Then restart the service:

```bash
/etc/init.d/ndoutils restart
```

### Centreon

Finally, we arrive at Centreon! Let's download the latest version, decompress it, then start the installation:

```bash
cd ~
wget "http://download.centreon.com/index.php?id=105"
tar -xzf centreon-2.0.2.tar.gz
cd centreon-2.0.2
./install.sh -i
```

And that's it... the installation has started!!! So, here are the steps one by one (we'll follow the method step by step in case you have differences):

You will now read Centreon Licence.
	Press enter to continue.

Press enter, then accept (or not) the GNU license:

....
q

Do you accept GPL license?
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

Enter y.

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Please choose what you want to install
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you want to install: Centreon Web Front
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

Well, the frontend is important, it's actually the main reason we're installing it:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Please choose what you want to install
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you want to install: Centreon Web Front
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

So enter **y**.

```
Do you want to install: Centreon CentCore
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

For my part, I'll say yes (y). But you should decide based on your needs. CentCore allows you to have satellites in datacenters or branches, for example, to avoid false alerts in case of line loss between your server and agents (like NRPE or NCSA).

To summarize, if you're going to deploy a large architecture, I recommend it; otherwise, leave it as no.

Next for Nagios plugins, of course we'll install them:

```
Do you want to install: Centreon Nagios Plugins
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

So enter **y**.

```
Do you want to install: Centreon Snmp Traps process
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

Again, if you need to receive SNMP traps from your equipment (like Cisco, Alcatel, Brocade, etc.), then activate this; otherwise, it's not necessary. For me, I need it so I enter **y**.

```
Where is your Centreon directory?
default to [/usr/local/centreon]

Do you want me to create this directory? [/usr/local/centreon]
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

If the folder suits you, enter **y**; otherwise, create it and modify the path. I'll keep it (so y).

```
Path /usr/local/centreon                                   OK

Where is your Centreon log directory
default to [/usr/local/centreon/log]
```

Now, let's create a proper log directory at `/var/log/centreon`:

```
> /var/log/centreon

Do you want me to create this directory? [/var/log/centreon]
[y/n], default to [n]:
> y
Path /var/log/centreon                                     OK
```

Now, the configuration files. The default location is just fine:

```
Where is your Centreon etc directory
default to [/etc/centreon]
```

That's perfect, so press 'enter'.

```
Do you want me to create this directory? [/etc/centreon]
[y/n], default to [n]:
> y

Path /etc/centreon                                         OK
```

And yes, it will create it (y).

PS: If you're getting tired, you can take a break; it's still a bit long.

```
Where is your Centreon generation_files directory?
default to [/usr/local/centreon]

Path /usr/local/centreon                                   OK
```

This looks good to me (enter).

```
Where is your Centreon variable library directory?
default to [/var/lib/centreon]
>

Directory /var/lib/centreon does not exists.               CRITICAL

Where is your Centreon variable library directory?
default to [/var/lib/centreon]
> 

Do you want me to create this directory? [/var/lib/centreon]
[y/n], default to [n]:
> y

Path /var/lib/centreon                                     OK
```

We validate again.

```
Where is the RRD perl module installed [RRDs.pm]
default to [/usr/lib/perl5/RRDs.pm]

Path /usr/lib/perl5                                        OK
/usr/bin/rrdtool                                           OK
/usr/bin/mail                                              OK
```

Great, the paths are correct, we validate. And for PEAR?

```
Where is PEAR [PEAR.php] 
default to [/usr/share/php/PEAR.php]

Path /usr/share/php                                        OK
```

Great, it's correct again... we're lucky! Shall we continue?

```
Where is installed Nagios?
default to [/usr/local/nagios]
```

This is wrong! Since we installed nagios via Debian repositories, not via source, the path is incorrect. The correct path is **/usr/share/nagios3**:

```
/usr/share/nagios3

Path /usr/share/nagios3                                    OK

Where is your nagios config directory
default to [/usr/local/nagios/etc]
```

Here we'll enter **/etc/nagios3**:

```
Where is your nagios config directory
default to [/usr/local/nagios/etc]
/etc/nagios3

Path /etc/nagios3                                          OK
```

Let's enter **/var/log/nagios3** here, which will contain the nagios.log file:

```
Where is your Nagios var directory?
default to [/usr/local/nagios/var]
/var/log/nagios3

Path /var                                                  OK
```

The directory below is supposed to contain all the plugins. We'll enter **/usr/lib/nagios/plugins**:

```
Where is your Nagios plugins (libexec) directory?
default to [/usr/local/nagios/libexec]
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins

Path /lib                                                  OK
/usr/sbin/nagios3                                          OK
```

Now, the location of the logos that we'll change to **/usr/share/nagios3/htdocs/images/logos**:

```
Where is your Nagios image directory?
default to [/usr/local/nagios/share/images/logos]
/usr/share/nagios3/htdocs/images/logos 

Path /usr/share/nagios3/htdocs/images/logos                OK
/usr/sbin/nagios3stats                                     OK
p1_file: /usr/lib/nagios3/p1.pl                           OK
/usr/bin/php                                               OK
/usr/bin/perl                                              OK
```

For CentPlugins, we'll leave everything at default and let it create the directory:

```
Where is your CentPlugins Traps binary
default to [/usr/local/centreon/bin]

Do you want me to create this directory? [/usr/local/centreon/bin]
[y/n], default to [n]:

Path /usr/local/centreon/bin                               OK
Finding Apache group:                                     www-data
Finding Apache user:                                      www-data
Finding Nagios user:                                      nagios
Finding Nagios group:                                     nagios
```

For the ndo library, it's **/usr/lib/ndoutils/ndomod-mysql-3x.o**:

```
Where is your NDO ndomod binary? 
default to [/usr/sbin/ndomod.o]
/usr/lib/ndoutils/ndomod-mysql-3x.o

/usr/lib/ndoutils/ndomod-mysql-3x.o                        OK
```

Now, for sudo configuration, everything is good by default, we don't touch anything, it does everything automatically:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Configure Sudo
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where is sudo configuration file
default to [/etc/sudoers]

/etc/sudoers                                               OK
Nagios init script                                         OK
Your sudo is not configured

Do you want me to configure your sudo? (WARNING) 
[y/n], default to [n]:
> y
Configuring Sudo                                           OK
```

Now comes the time for Apache. It offers to make the configuration for us (great):

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Configure Apache server
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you want to add Centreon Apache sub configuration file?
[y/n], default to [n]:
```

So enter y, to reload the configuration and finally check the modules (y):

```
Do you want to reload your Apache?

Create /usr/local/centreon/www/install/install.conf.php    OK
Create /etc/centreon/instCentWeb.conf                      OK
```

Now, CentStorage will be installed and is called ODS (Oreon Data Storage). It allows us to archive RRD graphs in MySQL.

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Start CentStorage Installation

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Start CentCore Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where is your CentCore binary directory
default to [/usr/local/centreon/bin]

```

Done!!! We thought it would never end! If their script could do auto-detection, we would save time. And if it was packaged, it would be even better! But well, it's their livelihood! It's already free; we shouldn't complain too much!

Let's restart the Apache service and proceed:

```bash
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

## Configuration

### Centreon

We can now move on to the graphical interface! First, let's set the correct permissions on the nagios3 folder:

```bash
chown -Rf nagios:www-data /etc/nagios3
chmod -Rf 775 /etc/nagios3
```

Now, let's connect to http://your-server/centreon and start the installation:

![Centreon1](/images/centreon1.avif)

![Centreon2](/images/centreon2.avif)

![Centreon3](/images/centreon3.avif)

![Centreon4](/images/centreon4.avif)

Everything should be good so far.

![Centreon5](/images/centreon5.avif)

Adjust the values for your database.

![Centreon6](/images/centreon6.avif)

![Centreon7](/images/centreon7.avif)

Specify the user who will be the Centreon admin.

![Centreon8](/images/centreon8.avif)

For my part, I chose to have my users connect via LDAP, so I configure my OpenLDAP parameters below.

![Centreon9](/images/centreon9.avif)

![Centreon10](/images/centreon10.avif)

![Centreon11](/images/centreon11.avif)

![Centreon12](/images/centreon12.avif)

All is good, the installation is complete :-)

#### Nagios

Now, let's move on to configuration. Go to Configuration -> Nagios -> nagios.cfg and modify the following lines:

```
Log file: /var/log/nagios3/nagios.log
Downtime File: /var/cache/nagios3/downtime.log
Comment File: /var/cache/nagios3/comment.log
Temp File: /var/cache/nagios3/nagios.tmp
Lock File: /var/cache/nagios3/nagios.lock
Status File: /var/log/nagios3/status.log
External Command File: /var/lib/nagios3/rw/nagios.cmd
```

Go to Configuration -> Nagios -> nagios.cfg -> Data and modify the following lines:

```
Service Performance Data File: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/process-service-perfdata
```

Go to Configuration -> Nagios -> cgi -> Cgi.cfg and modify the following lines:

```
URL HTML Path: /nagios3
Nagios Process Check Command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nagios /var/log/nagios3/status.log 5 '/usr/sbin/nagios3'
```

Save and then run this command:

```bash
chown nagios. /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/process-service-perfdata
```

#### ndo2db

* First, let's set the basic parameters. Take your beautiful graphical interface and go to: Configuration -> Centreon -> ndo2db.cfg -> Main, then modify this:

```
Socket Type: unix
Socket Name: /var/cache/nagios3/ndo.sock
```

* Now go to Configuration -> Centreon -> ndo2db.cfg -> Main -> Database and adapt it to your configuration. For my part, I had to change the following fields:

```
Database Name: ndoutils
User: ndoutils
Password: password
```

Set the password you want and save. Then do the same for this user at the SQL level:

```bash
mysql -uroot -p
```

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR 'ndoutils'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('password');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### ndomod

Let's go to Configuration -> Centreon -> ndo2db.cfg and modify these parameters:

```
Instance Name: default
Interface Type: unixsocket
Output: /var/cache/nagios3/ndo.sock
Buffer File: /var/cache/nagios3/ndomod.tmp
```

Then save and restart the service:

```bash
/etc/init.d/ndoutils restart
```

#### CentStorage

Now we need to configure CentStorage which will allow us to create beautiful graphs. To do this, go to Administration -> Options -> CentStorage -> Options, then modify the following:

```
Perfdata: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/process-service-perfdata
Drop file: /var/lib/centreon/service-perfdata.tmp
Nagios current log file to parse: /var/log/nagios3/nagios.log
```

We'll also set permissions on the logs directory, otherwise centstorage won't be able to create its logs:

```bash
chown -Rf nagios. /var/log/centreon
```

Then let's restart CentStorage:

```bash
/etc/init.d/centstorage restart
```

### Languages

### PhpSysInfo

For those who don't know, PhpSysInfo is integrated into Centreon (they're right, why reinvent the wheel). To make some nice tweaks, here's the config file:

```php
$default_template='aq';
$loadbar = true;
```

This gives us an aqua theme (like Mac OS X) and a system load bar, which is nice. You can also configure other info about disk temperature, etc... I invite you to check out [the official documentation](https://phpsysinfo.sourceforge.net).

### Enabling the Nagios Web Interface

We'll enable this interface for 2 reasons:

* Basic file permissions
* Having a backup interface

Let's create the file (unless it already exists) /etc/nagios3/htpasswd.users by directly adding a nagios user to it. For this, we'll use the htpasswd command:

```bash
htpasswd -c /etc/nagios3/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

Set a password. If you need to add other users, do the same without the "-c", for example:

```bash
htpasswd /etc/nagios3/htpasswd.users deimos
```

Then reload your Apache config. Next, you'll need to modify the Centreon configuration by going to Configuration -> Nagios -> cgi, and replacing nagiosadmin with the nagios user. Then reload your Nagios config from Centreon.

## FAQ

### Connection Error to NDO DataBase!

This is due to the packaged installation of Debian! It's not much to fix.

Look above, [the answer is there](#ndo2db).

### movement KO

If you have these types of errors when loading your Nagios config from Centreon, it's either a permission problem or an NDOutils problem. Make sure you've followed the procedure described [above](#NDOutils).

### Warning: File '/var/lib/centreon/service-perfdata' could not be opened - service performance data will not be written to file!

If this happens in the nagios logs, don't panic, just reset the permissions:

```bash
chown nagios. /var/lib/centreon/service-perfdata
```

Then restart nagios!

### DB Error

You might have a message like this in the centAcl.log file:

```
DB Error: DELETE FROM `centreon_acl` WHERE `group_id` = '14' [nativecode=1146 ** Table 'ndoutils.centreon_acl' doesn't exist]
```

This means the 'centreon_acl' table is missing. Let's create it:

```bash
mysql -uroot -p
```

```sql
use ndoutils;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `centreon_acl` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
`host_name` varchar(255) default NULL,
`service_description` varchar(255) default NULL,
`group_id` int(11) default NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
KEY `host_name` (`host_name`),
KEY `service_description` (`service_description`),
KEY `group_id` (`group_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
quit;
```

### I don't have graphs, no errors

A small reboot would be good. I know we're not on Windows, but there are so many services around Centreon that a small reboot would help all these services start correctly and reset certain things.

### From Centreon my Nagios export works without errors, yet I don't see my new services appearing

This is due to the CGI user not matching. It's true that a test is missing here that could validate the permissions. In the meantime, it's quite blocking; I advise you to check out [enabling the Nagios web interface](#enabling-the-nagios-web-interface) to solve your problem.
