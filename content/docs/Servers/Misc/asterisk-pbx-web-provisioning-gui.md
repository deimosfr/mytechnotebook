## Introduction

[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) is an open-source software that transforms a computer into a private telephone exchange or PABX. Asterisk is published under the GPL license.

Asterisk provides features such as voicemail, conferencing, voice servers, and call distribution. Asterisk implements the H.323 and SIP protocols, as well as a specific protocol called IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange). This IAX protocol allows communication between two Asterisk servers as well as between an Asterisk client and server. Asterisk can also act as a registrar and gateway with public networks (PSTN, GSM, etc.).

Asterisk is extensible via scripts or modules in Perl, C, Python, PHP, and more.
