## Introduction

When you manage outgoing emails through SMTP, you may sometimes need to test if a service is able to send correctly emails and itself check that there were no issue during sending. You can create a black hole for a specific domain and Postfix will answer from the same manner as if it is ok. It also permits to test Postfix sending capacities on a server.

## Installation

Of course you need Postfix:

```bash
aptitude install postfix
```

## Configuration

In the Postfix main configuration, add transport map line (`/etc/postfix/main.cf`):

```bash
[...]
transport_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/blackhole_map
[...]
```

Now add the fake domain to the transport map file (`/etc/postfix/blackhole_map`):

```bash
blackhole.com     discard:silently
```

Let's generate the map now:

```bash
postmap -c /etc/postfix /etc/postfix/blackhole_map
```

Now restart postfix and you will see in your logs something like this:

```
postfix/discard[1435]: [ID 897546 mail.info] 4D847A5B: to=<john@blackhole.com>, relay=none, delay=13, delays=13/0/0/0, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (silently)
```
