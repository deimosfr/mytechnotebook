## Introduction

If you want to quickly test [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)[^1], whether for playing around or developing with it, [DevStack](https://devstack.org/)[^2] is currently the fastest method.

I started with an Ubuntu Server 12.04 base as this distribution is one of the versions recommended by DevStack. The goal here is to have a VM with all OpenStack services installed and functional.

## Installation

To set up DevStack, we'll need git:

```bash
aptitude install git git-core
```

Now let's get the current version of DevStack, and switch to the desired version (Grizzly):

```bash
git clone git://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git
cd devstack
git checkout stable/grizzly
```

Then launch the installation and provide all requested passwords:

```bash
./stack.sh
```

## Utilization

To launch a development stack:

```bash
./stack.sh
```

When the installation is complete, you can access the different services like this:

- Horizon: http://server/
- Keystone: http://server:5000/v2.0/

The default users are admin and demo
