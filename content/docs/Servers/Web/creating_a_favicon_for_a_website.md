## Introduction

A favicon is the small icon you see at the top of your browser, next to the URL. If you have a 16x16 size image, you can use the following method to convert it to the right format.

## Converting an Image

```bash
convert -colors 256 -resize 16x16 face.jpg face.ppm && ppmtowinicon -output favicon.ico face.ppm
```
