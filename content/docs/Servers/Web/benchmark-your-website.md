## Introduction

It's useful to know how many connections your web server can handle. It's important to see how your server behaves under load. That's why it's necessary to benchmark it. We'll see here how to benchmark it, and then we'll look at some differences when using cache servers.

For my tests, I started with an Nginx server, then added a Varnish server in front.

## Installation

For benchmarking, there's the ab command (Apache Benchmark). To install it:

```bash
aptitude install apache2-utils
```

## Running benchmarks

Here's how to use the ab command:

```bash
ab -c <occurrences> -t <time> <website>
```

- occurrences: defines the number of parallel requests
- time: the time (in seconds) that the tests should run
- website: the website to benchmark (use a complete address, like an index.php or index.html)

The tests below are conducted between a server with a 1Gb/s bandwidth and a client with 100Mb/s through the Internet. However, it's important to understand that the source of your tests is extremely important.
Indeed, a local network or loopback will be much more telling in terms of benchmarks than an Internet network.

{{< alert context="info" text="I recommend doing your benchmarks on loopback if you have the possibility" />}}

### Wordpress

Here's the command I used to benchmark my blog:

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[17]}
> ab -c 5 -t 30 http://blog.deimos.fr/index.php

 100%    395 (longest request)
```

Here, the server is capable of handling 369 requests per second. That's pretty good, but **the CPU on the server side was close to 80%**.

Now, let's add [a cache server]({{< ref "docs/Servers/Web/Caches">}}) like [Varnish]({{< ref "docs/Servers/Web/Caches/varnish_a_website_accelerator.md">}}), then run the benchmarks again:

```bash {linenos=table,hl_lines=[26]}

```

We get a decent gain, the big difference is that **the CPU is below 20% with Varnish**!

### Mediawiki

I also benchmarked the wiki. Again, the CPU was overloaded without a cache server and the information speaks for itself:
