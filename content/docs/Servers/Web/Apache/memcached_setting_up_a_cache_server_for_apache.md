## Introduction

Memcached is a caching server that helps accelerate client requests.

## Setup

Here's documentation for setting up a memcached cache server:

[Installing memcached And The PHP5 memcache Module](/pdf/installing_memcached_and_the_php5_memcache_module.pdf)

## Other

To get statistics on memcached and calculate hits and ratios:

```bash
echo -en "stats\r\n" "quit\r\n" | nc localhost 11211 | tr -s [:cntrl:] " "| cut -f42,48 -d" " | sed "s/\([0-9]*\)\s\([0-9]*\)/ \2\/\1*100/" | bc -l
```
